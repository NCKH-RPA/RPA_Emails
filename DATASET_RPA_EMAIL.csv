It’s pretty clear that the old 9300 HUB doesn’t support the latest technologies, and cannot work compatible with SpaceBridge VASAT system.

As I asked before, does the new system need to be fully redundant? And also, if Mesh network is required for future applications.

1. The compatible with the physical layer or Network IP layer?

3.2 - Modem should be compatible: with exist 9300 HUB system and auto tracking antenna

"Gyro heading and GPS are 2 different factors, The GPS is used to calculate target angles, The heading reference allows the antenna to have a relative AZ(Relative to Bow) this allow for faster tracking after beam change, search due to signal loss and after initialisation.

Using the antenna in none gyro mode will only increase search time to find satellite by no more than around 1min,

In regards to CPI decrease it would be recommend to check skew assembly and calibrations, Also depending on provider these results seem to vary.

Dear Duc,

As per my explanation during my last visit at AECC, this email having some introduction of a pneumatic plug @ STOPPER used to plug/seal any type of pipeline for maintenance or service work. 

PRONAL having a know-how on this stopper since more than 30 years of experience and would make us a pioneer of this solution. We are not only supplying the STOPPER unit, but able to customize it to suit your need for your application with a competitive price.
The advantage of the STOPPER compared to the mechanical plug (conventional method) are:

• STOPPER having higher sealing stroke so that it can cover several pipe diameters
• STOPPER can follow to contour of the pipe (overcome sealing on pipe’s ovality problem)
• STOPPER pressure can always be monitored (consistency of sealing at all time)
• STOPPER easy to use as plug and play and no effort needed during operation
• STOPPER is light to carry – easy handling during operation

There are a lot several type of STOPPERS which can be presented to you upon your availability at your/client office.

It would be useful to the technical, engineering, and maintenance team for this kind of presentation.

Thank you so much for your time reading this email and please let me know on your availability for me make a presentation to you

Dear Mr. Nguyen,

Please note the following updates:

1. 50% payment with order received with thanks and production started.

2. We have the manufacturing drawings for the Wagner R 6.3 rotary vane which was built about 10 years ago. The UHMW Poly seals are very critical and due to variations in the Rotary Vane manufacturing, some adjustments may have to be made during assembly and testing during installation. 

We have offered to send an engineer during installation if required. Note that the system originally included an instruction manual with the equipment which is not available anymore.

The drawings do not include seal dimensions and they vary and occasionally require some adjustment during installation.

3. Clarification: the Purchase Order Pos. nr 38 is shown on the original drawings as a stator vane but this is incorrect. The stator vane is shown on the drawings as Pos. 9 and Pos. 38 is actually a rotor vane. We will be supplying Pos. 38 as a rotor vane seal.

As mentioned before it is as PDF file. You can print it by yourself but there is no original document. 

Certificate of Origin & Certificate of Material needs to be ordered in advance with the shutter. 
It is not possible to request the certificates after production of the shutter. 

Certificate of Conformity (COC) issued by manufacturer: Original 

As mentioned before it is as PDF file. You can print it by yourself but there is no original document. Please find the certificate in the attachment how it will look like for the FRS A-60 SL. It is the only one we provide.

Thus, please keep the original offer of 14-16 weeks. It was an old quotation which is not valid anymore. You can see the validity on each quotation. 
I am sorry but as you also can see on the quotation the delivery time start from complete commercial and technical clarification. We have not promised the delivery time. Sorry it is not possible to reduce the delivery time.

My humble apologies for the error. Thank you for catching it and bringing it to my attention. 

I have corrected the part numbers in the table below. In fact the pricing for the comparable units do not change, except for the standard NJT8318UN which actually goes up in price.

Regarding these NJT8318UF BUCs, the price for those units is $1,881, but we are out of stock and the lead time is 45-60 days ARO. 

On the other hand we have two units, the NJT8318UFMR & NJT8318UFMK that are in stock and on sale. These units are identical to the NJT8318UF with extra features. I’ve attached the spec sheet so you can see. The “R” means it comes with an RS232 remote interface. The break down looks like this

I also showed them my application history because no such order was fulfilled, but now they don't listen to it and have sent a legal notice about no payment from the customer . So I ask you to solve the problem as soon as possible.
Because I can't receive these calls and letters every day. All my family members are also stressed by this. I hope you take it seriously and respond as soon as possible. If not, I also have to sue.
I did not expect this from this too famous app and I am your main member. I'm really worried now and will think twice before buying anything from here as it let me down for no reason.
I will wait for your response and your support to clarify this soon.
Thank you for understanding my situation

I ordered 3 pairs of shoes from your store on September 5, 2022. However, more than 1 week has passed, I still have not received the goods. I contacted customer service, they promised to solve it, but until now I have not received the goods.

"Dear Mr. Tkani?ka
I am writing to you to voice my deep dissatisfaction with both the quality of goods and service I received at Bi'tis shop on Masaryk Street in Brno.
On October 14, I purchased at the above shop a pair of white thick-soled climbing boots at a price of €140.00, with a fifteen-year warranty. I was assured by the shop assistant that the boots are of incomparable quality and comfort, suitable for the most extreme mountain conditions.
Unfortunately, neither quality nor comfort proved to be the case, even though I meticulously followed the instructions for use. First, after one day of light hiking, dark grey stains began to appear on the instep of both boots. Then, in mid-trip, the sole stitching of the left boot came suddenly loose, causing the whole boot to literally fall apart.
Due to this accident, I was forced to cancel my trip to the Alps only two days after I arrived, which has caused me a loss of €1000.00. This is not to mention the massive inconvenience I suffered by having to climb down the mountains with ruined footwear on and thus putting my life and health at serious risk.
I contacted the respective shop immediately after my return to the Czech Republic and demanded a full refund, but was absolutely appalled by the way I was dealt with. The shop assistant flatly refused to return the money, saying that the boots were of different colour than at the time of purchase – i.e. they were no longer pure white - and therefore they could not be regarded as the same goods. At my insistence the shop manager was called in; however, she neither was willing to make a refund and even remarked that I should not have bought climbing boots if I could not wear them properly.
Considering all the nuisance, I think that both a replacement pair of boots and a refund of €400.00 would be an appropriate compensation. I realise that mistakes happen but in my case, the fault on the side of the producer was of great seriousness and, in addition to this, the behaviour of the staff was inexcusable. I've long been a user of Bata’s products and up until now have always considered you to be an excellent organization. I have every faith therefore that you will do what you can to rectify this situation.
I look forward to your reply.
Yours sincerely",1
"Dear Sir,
I would like to express my disappointment from your unsatisfactory level of service. I have expected much more from a prestigious and reputed company of your standard. Unfortunately, I can not help but submit this letter of complaint hoping for a fast and adequate resolution.
On 12/10/2021, I went to your store to buy the new shoes but the staff did not welcome me. He was unfriendly and looked at me like I can't afford for the shoes. When I asked him, he ignored me and talked with other customers.
I hope you agree with me that this is not acceptable under any circumstances. I trust that you will deal with this issue in a top urgent fashion. I also trust that you will take the necessary precautions to prevent such incidents in the future.

"What happened to Bitis??? I have a pair of shoes that I was about to return because they arrived (very) late, but for some reason they are not listed in my order history. Therefore, I cannot process returns online. I sent an email to service@shoes.com . NOTHING. In the last week, I've been on hold for an hour several times and ended up hanging up.

I’m having this issue now only when trying to reach them by phone there is only a recording instructing me to contact them via email. I’ve already done that several times. I ordered my daughter a pair of boots on the Fall and had no issues other than I felt shipping took longer than it should have. It appears from reading all the previous comments that it’s going to be a while before I get any kind of results with downloading the return shipping labels and even longer before I see any kind of refund. I will definitely NEVER shop with SHOES.COM again. I’m very disappointed.,1
"Dear Mr. Richardson:
I had recently ordered a pair of sports shoes (Item # 1234) from your company's website on February 05, 2008. I received the sports shoes on February 10. On opening the parcel, I found that the shoes were defective. There is a small tear in the front part of the left shoe. My order number is CD789456.
I am sending the parcel back to your company address with this letter. The shoes were an urgent requirement so I have purchased another pair from a local sports shop. As I have already bought a pair, you can credit the amount to my account once you receive the parcel.
Thank you for patiently reading this letter. I have been a loyal customer of your company for last five years. I never had a problem with any of your products. This has happened for the first time. Will get back to you if I need any sports equipment in the future.

"Dear sales manager,
I am writing to complain about a faulty item that I purchased on your online store on January 3rd, 2019.
The complaint is related to a pair of Bi'tis sneakers that arrived with various anomalies. First, when I opened the box, I noticed that one of the pairs didn't have a shoe pad. Secondly, it was easy to see that the shoelaces were too short. Thirdly, and to my surprise, one of the shoes was bigger than the other. In fact, one was a size 11 and the other was a size 11and a half. To make things worse, the interior fitting was ripped in both sneakers. I demand a full refund or the replacement of the item that I ordered. I am sure that this matter will receive your prompt attention. I hope to hear from you as soon as possible.

"Dear Bi'tis,
I am writing this in connection with my order dated January 12, 2018. Delivery was scheduled two days back and I still have not received my order. This prolonged delay caused significant monetary loss and inconvenience to my business. The items in the order are a priority and as you promised on time delivery, I have agreed to proceed with the transaction.
Please let me know if you can deliver by tomorrow at the latest, I will have to cancel the order, as I can't wait any longer and will get it from anywhere else. This isn't the first time I've complained about delivery delays on an order, you've been repeating this pattern for a month for each order.
I called your customer service representative yesterday but she placed my complaint and did not take any action. I don't expect such kind of unacceptable behavior from a company that operates in some cities like you.

Thank you for your prompt execution of our order of 25th May. We took the delivery of the consignment today in the morning.

"Vide Cash Memo 789718, Dt : July 15, 2002, I purchased a pair of shoes from your Company outlet for Rs 995 and only after ten days the sole of right shoe got detached and I showed it to the In charge of the outlet who got it repaired and I took it back within a couple of days. Strangely enough, the sole of other shoe got detached and cuts appeared on the upper portion. I again visited the show-room and insisted that the shoes be replaced by a fresh one as is allowed by the rules of your company. The person refused doing so and also misbehaved with me.
Will you kindly issue instructions to the concerned to replace my shoes by a fresh one as it seems the shoes has some manufacture defect. I hope you will look into the matter personally and solve my problem.
Thanking you

"Dear Sir/Madam,
I had bought the following product of your company from a shop in HCM. I am very disappointed to say that my legitimate warranty claim has not been honored.
(i) Name of the Product: Sneaker
Date of the Purchase: 2/3/2022
Address & Telephone No.: HCM & 562-521-523 
(ii) Brand: (v) Amount Paid: Bi'tis (v) 500$
Within days of buying your product, it started showing technical problems. It seems like a manufacturing default in the product. I went to the shop where I had bought the product and I conveyed to the shop owner/manager the problems with the product.
After showing him the warranty card, I had requested him to have the product repaired or replaced so that I can get a fully functioning product without any faults in it. I was shocked to notice that the shop owner/manager abused me in front of everyone present and rejected my genuine claim.
Therefore, I kindly request your goodself to look into the issue and provide me with a solution as soon as possible. I am enclosing herewith a copy of the purchase invoice and warranty card for your kind reference.
Thank you for your valuable time and cooperation.
Yours faithfully,",1

"Dear Sirs,
Children grow so quickly, so of course I never expected my son's shoes to fall apart before his feet became too large for them. Unfortunately, this was not the case.
I purchased a pair of Skotchers tennis shoes shortly before the start of this school year in September. Within a month, the rubber sole of the shoes had begun to detach, rendering the shoes unsafe for wear as well as visually unpleasing. I've never seen anything like this before. My son is only in kindergarten, and not rough on clothing. The shoes look like new, expect for the loosely hanging sole.
I have enclosed a photo for your reference. You can clearly see the rubber sole has separated and is hanging loosely to the side.
My entire family has worn Skotchers for years and has never had reason to complain. I expect this is a rare defect, and that there will be no issue with getting a replacement.
While the shoes still fit my son, I don't know how much longer he will wear a size 9. I am asking that you either (1) replace the shoes with a pair of the same style in size 10; (2) replace the shoes with a comparable size 10 tennis shoe; or (3) refund my total purchase amount of $32.99.
Thank you for your attention to this matter. Please feel free to contact me at 555-555-5555 if you would like more information about the shoes, or if you would like to provide a postage-paid box or envelope in which I can return them to you..
Appreciatively,
Trully.",1
"Dear Sir,
My name is Adison who purchased online shoes from your shop and my order number is #26102001. However, against all my expectations, I was fairly dissatisfied with quality of the product and its delayed arrival.
Firstly, I placed the order online on 15th January. But not until two weeks had gone by did I receive this product while you promised to send it to me for around 6 days. Secondly, the product I got is faulty one and it is far different from what I saw on the website. The material and patterns of the shoes only have a few similarities in comparison with the product you suggested me. In addition to, you gave me a yellow one instead of sending me a white dress as I ordered.
I will not demand a refund but please arrange for a replacement of this product at the earliest. I hope that this problem will be solved promptly.

"The Manager,
We bought running shoes from Bi'tis. It's not even been a year now and the pasting of the shoes has come out completely from all sides.
The shoes are not up to the mark the way the pasting has come out from all sides. I would request a replacement for my shoes at the earliest possible as they are torn off and the pasting has come out from all sides which is a ""Black Spot"" for such an expensive brand like Bi'tis as repairing or servicing the shoes won't serve the purpose. We don't expect such quality shoes from a company like Bi'tis after paying so much. We would rather request people not to buy shoes from a company like Bi'tis where the quality of shoes is so poor that it does not even last for one year even after you spend so much.
I have given my shoes to the Bi'tis company showroom at Shubham Complex, R. C Dutt Road Alkapuri, Vadodara India -390007.
Expecting a satisfactory reply at the earliest from your side.

I bought your company’s sneaker on January 7th. The bill and a short video are attached with the email. We used this sneaker for a few hours only but it sometimes starts torn.

"Dear Mr. Penn,
I have been a loyal customer of your shoe center for the past five years. However I am writing this letter to file a complaint against the unsatisfactory services that the store has been providing for the past few months.
From the past few visits, I feel that the attendees present in the shop firstly ignore the customers and then behave rudely when they ask for any item. I visited your shoe store on 25th June, 2014 and found myself standing for ten minutes before one of the attendees approached me to know my needs. When I asked him for the item I needed, he showed me one or two varieties which I did not like. Soon after my denial to these varieties, he started getting annoyed and spoke rudely.
I have been visiting your shop for many years but have never experienced such a behavior from your previous staff. Kindly pay attention to my complaint and look into this matter as soon as possible as this kind of behavior is not at all acceptable.
Sincerely,
Sarah Parker.",1
"The problem is similar to many of the problems above. Ordered a pair of shoes on 5/31 and got charged for the shoes, but still no shipping info. Status says ""shipping label not generated"". Get a canned reply by email and if I call, I'll be paused or paused. Obviously they have big problems. I suspect that this is a supply chain issue as many companies are dealing with, but then they should be VERY clear on their website about delays and not offering free 4-9 day shipping . And, for the love of God, please improve your customer service and let everyone know what's going on. Maybe just be honest and add a warning message to your site. Most customers quite understand when companies are honest and transparent. The way that Shoes.com is currently handling this will cost many loyal customers a loss.",1

Attached is the complaint that EES intends to file tomorrow against SCE related to the recoupment of our Negative CTC. As you aware, after returning our customers to DA recently, our billing department was expecting that the past Negative CTCs would be returned to our customer's accounts - this has not happened nor after conversations with SCE will it occur. 

This complaint is the next step in the process of attempting to recoup these funds. Primarily EES does not want to pay for Utility charges for our customers while an outstanding Negative CTC balance is due.

One key risk with filing this Complaint is that SCE may consolidate this case with the earlier Complaint that is currently on hold. Probably not too big of a downside.

We will be paying the bills into the CPUC for holding until the resolution of the Complaint.

Any questions or issues please let me know.

My name is Adison who purchased online shoes from your shop and my order number is #26102001. However, against all my expectations, I was fairly dissatisfied with quality of the product and its delayed arrival.
Firstly, I placed the order online on 15th January. But not until two weeks had gone by did I receive this product while you promised to send it to me for around 6 days. Secondly, the product I got is faulty one and it is far different from what I saw on the website. The material and patterns of the shoes only have a few similarities in comparison with the product you suggested me.

We bought running shoes from Bi'tis. It's not even been a year now and the pasting of the shoes has come out completely from all sides.
The shoes are not up to the mark the way the pasting has come out from all sides. I would request a replacement for my shoes at the earliest possible as they are torn off and the pasting has come out from all sides which is a ""Black Spot"" for such an expensive brand like Bi'tis as repairing or servicing the shoes won't serve the purpose. We don't expect such quality shoes from a company like Bi'tis after paying so much. We would rather request people not to buy shoes from a company like Bi'tis where the quality of shoes is so poor that it does not even last for one year even after you spend so much.

"Dear Sirs,
Children grow so quickly, so of course I never expected my son's shoes to fall apart before his feet became too large for them. Unfortunately, this was not the case.
I purchased a pair of Skotchers tennis shoes shortly before the start of this school year in September. Within a month, the rubber sole of the shoes had begun to detach, rendering the shoes unsafe for wear as well as visually unpleasing. I've never seen anything like this before. My son is only in kindergarten, and not rough on clothing. The shoes look like new, expect for the loosely hanging sole.
I have enclosed a photo for your reference. You can clearly see the rubber sole has separated and is hanging loosely to the side.
My entire family has worn Skotchers for years and has never had reason to complain. I expect this is a rare defect, and that there will be no issue with getting a replacement.
While the shoes still fit my son, I don't know how much longer he will wear a size 9. I am asking that you either (1) replace the shoes with a pair of the same style in size 10; (2) replace the shoes with a comparable size 10 tennis shoe; or (3) refund my total purchase amount of $32.99.
Thank you for your attention to this matter. Please feel free to contact me at 555-555-5555 if you would like more information about the shoes, or if you would like to provide a postage-paid box or envelope in which I can return them to you..

"Dear Mr. Tkani?ka
I am writing to you to voice my deep dissatisfaction with both the quality of goods and service I received at Bi'tis shop on Masaryk Street in Brno.
On October 14, I purchased at the above shop a pair of white thick-soled climbing boots at a price of €140.00, with a fifteen-year warranty. I was assured by the shop assistant that the boots are of incomparable quality and comfort, suitable for the most extreme mountain conditions.
Unfortunately, neither quality nor comfort proved to be the case, even though I meticulously followed the instructions for use. First, after one day of light hiking, dark grey stains began to appear on the instep of both boots. Then, in mid-trip, the sole stitching of the left boot came suddenly loose, causing the whole boot to literally fall apart.
Due to this accident, I was forced to cancel my trip to the Alps only two days after I arrived, which has caused me a loss of €1000.00. This is not to mention the massive inconvenience I suffered by having to climb down the mountains with ruined footwear on and thus putting my life and health at serious risk.
I contacted the respective shop immediately after my return to the Czech Republic and demanded a full refund, but was absolutely appalled by the way I was dealt with. The shop assistant flatly refused to return the money, saying that the boots were of different colour than at the time of purchase – i.e. they were no longer pure white - and therefore they could not be regarded as the same goods. At my insistence the shop manager was called in; however, she neither was willing to make a refund and even remarked that I should not have bought climbing boots if I could not wear them properly.
Considering all the nuisance, I think that both a replacement pair of boots and a refund of €400.00 would be an appropriate compensation. I realise that mistakes happen but in my case, the fault on the side of the producer was of great seriousness and, in addition to this, the behaviour of the staff was inexcusable. I've long been a user of Bata’s products and up until now have always considered you to be an excellent organization. I have every faith therefore that you will do what you can to rectify this situation.
I look forward to your reply.
Yours sincerely",1

On July 15 2020, I bought a shoes from your shop store. I was assured by the sales representative that this product was one of the most reliable products in the store, and if there were any issues, it would be covered by the warranty.
Though this is commonplace for sales representatives to say, it is quite odd that the product would not well work at all once I tried putting it to use. After emailing the store, I was told by the sales representative that I should have tested the product before purchasing it.
As you can imagine, it is quite unreasonable to expect such a large item to be tested in such a small space and in an inappropriate setting. I have written today to demand swift action against this representative and for an exchange of this defective product.

In fact, one was a size 11 and the other was a size 11and a half. To make things worse, the interior fitting was ripped in both sneakers. I demand a full refund or the replacement of the item that I ordered. I am sure that this matter will receive your prompt attention. I hope to hear from you as soon as possible.
Yours faithfully,

"Dear Mr. Penn,
I have been a loyal customer of your shoe center for the past five years. However I am writing this letter to file a complaint against the unsatisfactory services that the store has been providing for the past few months.
From the past few visits, I feel that the attendees present in the shop firstly ignore the customers and then behave rudely when they ask for any item. I visited your shoe store on 25th June, 2014 and found myself standing for ten minutes before one of the attendees approached me to know my needs. When I asked him for the item I needed, he showed me one or two varieties which I did not like. Soon after my denial to these varieties, he started getting annoyed and spoke rudely.
I have been visiting your shop for many years but have never experienced such a behavior from your previous staff. Kindly pay attention to my complaint and look into this matter as soon as possible as this kind of behavior is not at all acceptable.
Sincerely,
Sarah Parker.",1
"Thank you for your prompt delivery of our trial order No. 2098 of July 15. On examining the shoes, we found that the finish is poor because the coloring varies. We have sent you a parcel with some shoes to show you how inferior the finish is. However, if you are willing to grant us a discount of 25%, we might be able to find an outlet for the shoes.
Please let us know whether you find this acceptable.",1
"Dear Sir,
I have recently ordered a new pair of soccer cleats (item #6542951) from your website on June 21. I received the order on June 26. Unfortunately, when I opened it, I saw that the cleats were used. The cleats had dirt all over it and there was a small tear in front of the part where the left toe would go. My order number is AF26168156.
To resolve the problem, I would like you to credit my account for the amount charged for my cleats; I have already went out and bought a new pair of cleats at my local sporting goods store so sending another would result in me having two pairs of the same cleats.
Than you for taking the time to read this letter. I have been a satisfied customer of your company for
many years and this is the first time I have encountered a problem. If you need to contact me, you can
reach me at (555) 555-5555.

"Dear Sir,
I wish to complain about the shoes that I purchased on July 7.
I am complaining because I ordered a pair of size 40 shoes but I received another size, 38. To resolve this problem I would like you to refund or replacement of the shoes I ordered.
When I first learned of this problem, I contacted Ms Hoa at your company, and was told that nothing could be done about my problem. I believe that this response is unfair. I would like a written statement explaining your company’s position and what you will do about my complaint.
I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible to resolve this problem. If I do not hear from you within 7 days I will file complaints with the appropriate consumer agencies and consider my legal alternatives.
You may reply to me at this email or call me at (phone number).

"Dear Bi'tis,
I am writing this in connection with my order dated January 12, 2018. Delivery was scheduled two days back and I still have not received my order. This prolonged delay caused significant monetary loss and inconvenience to my business. The items in the order are a priority and as you promised on time delivery, I have agreed to proceed with the transaction.
Please let me know if you can deliver by tomorrow at the latest, I will have to cancel the order, as I can't wait any longer and will get it from anywhere else. This isn't the first time I've complained about delivery delays on an order, you've been repeating this pattern for a month for each order.
I called your customer service representative yesterday but she placed my complaint and did not take any action. I don't expect such kind of unacceptable behavior from a company that operates in some cities like you.
If you are unable to resolve my concern, please refund my full amount at the end of the day. If you don't answer my question, I'll have to take this to the next level.
I am waiting for your prompt response and action. Thank you.",1
"Dear Sirs,
On August 1, 2017, I ordered a pair of shoes and had them delivered to address 669, Dien Bien Phu street, district 1. Although I received your item within a week, the message subject is showing. address of another company.
However and all, I do not expect to receive the wrong product. Since our company is a large commercial brand, we have to maintain delivery time. But your delivery delay can also affect our business.
On top of that, I didn't receive any declaration from your side. It's offensive. This kind of carelessness can give your store a bad reputation.
I keep the shoes in their original form aside and gladly return the stationery with the necessary modifications under a separate cover. I would appreciate it if you send me the proper stationery ASAP.
In addition, I hope you will credit my account with $50 for the cost of returning the stationery. If you arrange the return by your company, I have no problem at all. Just let me know about it, and I won't take the initiative to return my own product.
Note; I will be forced to sue your store if I don't get a response from you within the next seven days regarding the box replacement.
I hope not to encounter this kind of difficulty any more. Thank you and look forward to your attention on this matter to resolve it quickly.

This letter informs you that I have received a product that was not ordered by me, but is still being claimed by the company and the delivery guy.

Since, 15th June was a Black Friday and discount of twenty-five percent was ongoing on this particular item which was affordable for me, I immediately placed the order. I thought that it would be an excellent birthday present for my mother.
I checked the selling policy and terms regarding delivery, it was quite clear that this shoes will be delivered within 5 working days and it was suitable for me because the birthday of my mother was after a week. However, I have received the shoes only yesterday when my mother’s birthday has already passed.

I have recently purchased a shoes from your website, my order number is #15695548, and my name is Linda. I bought a pair of discount shoes from your birthday sale. However, when I received the goods, I was not satisfied. I ordered purple shoes but the one I received were blue. I don't like that color. Can I return the product? I read your policy and it says it's possible.
Please reply my email as soon as you can.
Thank you

"Dear Bitis,
My name is Tom and I want to ask you some question about shipping policy. My order number #15634758. September 21st, I ordered a pair of pink #MP32 shoes for my girlfriend for her birthday. I noted that I want to receive it by September 30th. Because October 1st is my girlfriend's birthday. However, it's been 1 week since I placed my order today, but my order is reflected still in stock. I am writing this email to ask for support to receive the goods before September 30, no matter what the costs.
Yours sincerely
Tom",1
"Paul, 

Regarding the phone conversation we had last week, please be aware of the following: 
- I misspoke when I stated that a letter will be going out to Enron containing the details of the total assessment. The letter that did go out to customers was distributed on the TIE email list and was only a generic explanation. That email is included below for your information. 
- The details that I promised are included in the attached spreadsheet file. 
I am still trying to find out when you will receive the invoice for this assessment. When I have that information, I'll pass it on. 
I hope the attached information is useful to you.

"Dear Mr. Shapiro: 
I am a Master's student at Texas A&M University. I met with Paula Rieker of Investor Relations at Enron last Wednesday during the presentation she gave in the College of Business at Texas A&M. I have been interested in Enron for some time, and Ms. Rieker's presentation impressed me even further. 

I spoke with Ms. Rieker after her presentation about my interest in working in the Government Relations Department at Enron. She was kind enough to provide me with your name and phone number as a contact person. I have a Bachelor's degree in Government from The University of Texas at Austin. I feel that the combination of my undergraduate government degree and the graduate degree in marketing that I am currently pursuing makes government relations an ideal area for me. I am interested in a summer internship beginning in June 2002, which could possibly lead to full-time employment upon completion of my graduate degree in December 2002. I am attaching it! My resume for your review. 

Thank you for your time, Mr. Shapiro. I look forward to hearing from you concerning my interest in working at Enron.

"Jeff/Mike, 

I understand there is some concern regarding the take-or-pay exposure under the LNG contracts between DPC and Oman LNG and Adgas. First, there is no direct Enron Corp exposure. Both contracts are between DPC and the related supplier. There are no Corp performance guarantees in either SPA. Attached is a memo sent to Jim Hughes last month outlining the contractural obligations and current discussions with the suppliers. 

From a practical standpoint both suppliers will work with us to reschedule the start dates and to modify the fixed quantities. I met with both suppliers before the holidays and they reconfirmed they will work with Enron as they understand the problems in India. We have delayed the contractual start date under both contracts to the maximum extent possible: February 11, 2002 for Oman and April 30, 2002 for Adgas. What this means contracturally is more than a year to work with the suppliers. Both suppliers expect an update on DPC when I return to the Middle East next week and both do not expect to discuss any contract matters until the situation in India is clearer. I will be in New Mexico through tomorrow if you want to discuss further. My phone number is 505/336-8400.",2
"Bo, Attached is the draft of the gas agreement for the StageCoach transaction. There are still a few blanks for which Andrew is getting the information. Please review and let me know if you have any questions. 
Also to follow up on our discussion from earlier concerning who would actually contract with the PPL for the Utility Agreement; we had earlier discussed Tennessee Gas Pipeline contracting with the Utility with EES acting as their agent for interaction with the Utility. However, I think it should be EES who contracts with the Utility to receive electric service. TGP has contracted with ECS for Compression Services and ECS has contracted with EES for power. TGP has no need for a power deal. Let me know what you think about this. 
It is my understanding that EES is working on a revised draft of the TA for the Power Contract. Let me know if this is not correct. Thanks.",2
"Kay,

Our contact with GE tends to be indirect through turnkey contractors on power plants: the turnkey contractor usually contracts with GE instead of Enron as owner. So this would probably not be high on our list of priorities, although we would be interested to see what you come up with. 

You might want input on your process from our engineering team, led by John Chappell, so I have copied this to John.

I just received the ISN contract for the Olympics game. Should I send a copy to Ed at Milbank as well? Any reason Mark Holsworth needs to be involved?

"Rebecca, 

John Ayres and I met today. He wishes to add the interconnect piping between the chiller and cooling tower options in Exhibit N-2 for the ESA Electrobolt Project. This adds a total of $ 266,400 to the Jan 15, 2001 payment (equal to $ 33,280 per unit). There will be no effect on the 12/27/00 payment amount. I've edited your spread sheet to show this. 

John Ayres asked if he could have a stripped down version of the Spread sheet showing only the ESA amounts. 

Kay, You'll notice that the Cooling Tower Option is Exhibit N-2 was changed to add this interconnect piping to the scope. 

I hope this helps.

"Debra; 
Attached are documents for your review regarding Aquila's request of Enron to amend our current Gas contract to replace/assign the UtiliCorp responsibilities to Aquila, Inc. 
I have sent along for your review, the supporting documentation from both Moody's and S&P regarding the Aquila credit rating, the Secretary of State filing/order showing Aquila's name change, our underlying contract and a proposed amendment for your review/execution. 

It appears that this amendment is necessary because there has been a delay in the execution of a new contract which would have removed UtiliCorp as a party. 

Because of the Aquila spin off, we are under a significant time constraint to remove UCU from all Aquila contracts. 
If you have any questions regarding this, please do not hesitate to contact me.

"Mark, I heard earlier today that the resolution of this matter has been to move confirmation/documentation to Calgary, but leave contract preparation and negotiation in Houston. 

I must admit disappoint with this bifurcated result, including for the following reasons: 

1. It has left, rightly or (I trust) wrongly, the impression that there is concern as to the ability of the Canadian lawyers to documment and negotiate the ISDAs, etc. If this is the case, I do not share the concern. The legal group in Canada is strong, deep, conscientious, and regularly excels at greater and more complex challenges which expose Enron Canada to greater 
risks in physical trading, origination, finance and structured transactions. 

2. For these reasons, the Canadian lawyers have the trust and confidence of the Canadian traders and originators, and their advice is sought and followed on all matters, including, frankly, financial trading. 

3. This result ignores the practical realities of time, space, efficiency, legal jurisdictions, marketplace knowledge and internal and external relationships. 

4. I feel that the we ought to have the opportunity to be exposed to, and be challenged by, all aspects of our business. 

In any event, please let me know who will be responsible for legal oversight of confirmation/documentation of financial transactions. For physical trading, we regularly advise on confirmation/documentation issues and, most notably, all structured trades and trades with a term of greater than one year are prepared and reviewed by Enron Canada legal. 

Regards, Peter.",2
"Jordan, 

I think this looks good. There is one other area that you may want to include: Develop relationships with governmental agencies that enforce discrimination/affirmative action laws, regulations, and Executive Orders. 

I have been taking the lead on this, with support from Steve Kean and Cindy, but we are just starting the effort this month. Steve and I will meet with the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs this week, and I am hoping to meet with the head of the OFCCP (and, perhaps folks with EEOC in Washington) later in the month. I believe that cordial, cooperative relationships with these agencies can be invaluable in our diversity efforts. 

If you choose to include this activity, it probably would belong in the Communication or Resources sections (it could be included in the section on creation of external relationships). 

Let me know if you have any questions.

"Dear Ambassador Merrill, 

I understand that you and Betsy Ginsberg had a conversation at reunion last month about a possible partnership between the Fletcher School and Enron. Thank you for generously 
offering to help us explore this connection. We believe there are strong synergies between Professor Bill Moomaw's 
International Environment and Resource Policy program and Enron's business model. There is currently a strong recruiting relationship between Enron and Fletcher; there are nine Fletcherites at Enron at this time. I'm confident that our strong recruiting relationship is a solid first step from which to launch an even stronger partnership. 

In order to explore expanding this relationship Ms. Elise Kalmans, Director of Community Development, agreed to arrange a meeting for Bill and me last spring. Unfortunately, the scheduling did not work out, and Ms. Kalmans then began a maternity leave so we had trouble identifying a new 
point of contact. 

I appreciate your suggestion that we aim to work through Stephen Kean. As Senior Vice President for Public and Environmental and Government Affairs, he does sound like the ideal contact with whom to discuss Professor Moomaw's program and its students. How do you suggest we proceed? Should we send a letter from Interim Dean Trachtman to ask if Mr. Kean would be willing to meet with Professor Moomaw? May I mention that you suggested we write him? 

At Betsy's suggestion, I have attached the presentation outline we prepared for Enron, along with the letter we originally mailed to Elise. I would be very interested in any suggestions you may have. If you have any trouble opening the powerpoint file or word document, please let me know and I would be happy to mail or fax them. Thank you again for your kind offer of assistance.

"Hi guys. 

I wanted to let you know that I am extremely concerned about the Associate/Analyst program, so much so that I feel all the work I have done, and all the time I have spent on the program has had little impact outside Wharton/Penn recruiting. In fact we won't get more than 1 associate from Wharton this year for a variety of internal and external reasons. This program has brought incredible talent into the organization, but we have lost a lot of momentum over the last two years. 

In as much as I would like to continue to support the program, I can't in its current form, and don't have time to fix what I thought we had been addressing. The entire program is disfunctional, and the commercial teams are not lending support to the program. I'd be very happy to spend a few minutes of your time (rather than blather on in an email) to give you both my overview of the program, and suggest changes and improvements.

"As most of us have discussed, Harry Arora's group has been developing an e-commerce site now known as DealBench.com (formerly EnronDirectFinance). This site is being launched as an information dissemination/deal platform whose closest competitor is Intralinks. DealBench's customers will be banks, 
law firms, and other businesses who desire a secure internet platform to conduct business transactions online. Customers will license use of the site pursuant to written agreements. Several trademark applications have been filed by Enron Corp. for the site. Lawyers from Vinson & Elkins in Austin (Bob Baird and Dean Harvey) and Houston (Steve Borgman) have been assisting us in various legal matters relating to the site. 

At this point, the commercial team desires to move ahead with a limited liability entity to own and operate the DealBench business. Based upon input from many of you, the proposal is to form a simple, single-member, owner-managed Delaware limited liability company named DealBench L.L.C. he sole owner would be Enron Net Works LLC. Upon formation, all assets and liabilities of the DealBench business will be assigned to, and assumed by the new LLC. We understand that the private placement being contemplated by Net Works will be through a separate legal entity and currently does not 
contemplate the DealBench business. We also understand that DealBench's ownership by Net Works will not preclude future flexibility in DealBench's ownership. 

The commercial team desires to move forward with formation of DealBench L.L.C. this week. Based upon your input, we will proceed as outlined above. If you have any other thoughts or suggestions, please let me know. Thanks for your help.

We are trying to put the following process in place (for Houston): Books officialized in evening by risk management including risk management ensuring RisktRAC has all required information, errors noted and an e-mail sent to risk controls 7:30 am risk controls receives error listing (books which did not make it to RisktRAC) 7:30 - 8:30 explanations obtained for error received from risk management (if not received the night before) and log updated 8:30 meeting to discuss previous night's officialization process and general processes Log sent to bus. controllers, RAC - daily Note: I know that London, Sydney, and Japan have different processes. We have to work with your current processes to ensure that risk controls receives info on time.",1

"Cara et all, Following list of bug fixes are moving out to stage to address the recently reported issues: New versions of both applications have been moved out to stage.. PreSchedule Workspace: #1 Problem: Uploading to the Path Confirm Area:*accepted Mid C-1:53 Rockies-0:22 Palo 1:11 COB 0:49 (Row 69 Generated a General SQL error message) This is showing Physical and non-physical right. Solution: Line 69 , the timezone value under column G was '6/20/2001-6/20/2001' when it should have been 'PDT' or any other valid timezone value. #2 Problem: Running Build Route Report: Criteria Selection-unable to select criteria for build route, got ""List index out of bounds (4)"" error *needs fix Solution: Fixed.. was losing track of which workspace was open #3 Problem: Daily Summary Function *needs fix or workaround-Would not work at all, got 3 error messages. "" Unable to locate"" ""can't find last row!"", and ""Failed to export summary!"" this is going to create a csv file right to the AGG sched vol report now according to Mr. Poston, I am thrilled to hear it. Solution: Executive Report was just pushed to stage yesterday, the data is currently what we're focusing on with this release and will soon start shaping it to make it visualy look like the pre-existing excel-based Executive Report. #4 Problem: Error Checking - took 1:29, produced a line by line error sheet that is printable, *accepted BUT routing errors for lines 19-223 in the COB sheet produced a routing error that just states ""ERROR:"" no reason. We need to know why an error is shown(was run after all routes were deleted) *needs fix Solution: Error Checking will not spit out any errors if there aren't any. Path Confirmation: #1 Problem: One little housekeeping thing, can we move the delete button away from the confirm button? Perhaps on the other side of the exit button? This will save us mucho headaches later. OR make the dialog box look more like a warning that a record has been selected for deletion? Solution: Dialog box included for deletion alert confirmation purposes and button repositioned. thanks Asem x31700 PreSchedule Workspace: Running Build Route Report: Criteria Selection-unable to select criteria for build route, got ""List index out of bounds (4)"" error *needs fix Error Checking - took 1:29, produced a line by line error sheet that is printable, *accepted BUT routing errors for lines 19-223 in the COB sheet produced a routing error that just states ""ERROR:"" no reason.

Routing Mid C-13:27 Rockies-2:23 Palo 7:56 COB 5:12 the time is fine. **needs fix**The routes are still not showing designated Physical or Non-Physical Properly. All are coming through as Non-Physical. This is must be fixed prior to release for production as our WSCC fee pulls directly from this data in deal Scheduling. Path Confirmation: Speed is very much an issue here, I had Mark Guzman sit with me while I cut a path and when I confirmed a group of paths. The confirmation of 5 paths as a group took 70 seconds from the time I entered the name and hit the ""ok"" button until the confriming was completed. This is too long, we need this to be 20-30 seconds max. Currently, this process takes about 10 seconds in lotus. Confriming 2 paths with the 20th fully populated took 1:39. Cutting a path went fast enough until I closed the screen to go back to the confirmation report. This also took over a minute. This is another 10 second process in lotus. One little housekeeping thing, can we move the delete button away from the confirm button? Perhaps on the other side of the exit button? This will save us mucho headaches later. OR make the dialog box look more like a warning that a record has been selected for deletion? All of the sorting looks great, the paths are represented properly, we are very very close! Real Time Discussion: Where are we on this? I heard initial rumblings, but nothing lately. Here are the sheets that I have used to create data for 6/20 << File: COB_JUNE20_USEME.psc >> << File: Mid_C_June20.psc >> << File: Palo_June20.psc >> << File: Rockies_June_20.psc >> I can do more testing or Net meeting stuff tomorrow until about 10:30, but after that I have to be a scheduler for a couple of hours.

"Cara / Corry, I have released into stage new versions of PreSchedule and Path Confirmation. Included in the new release are... Pre-Schedule Workspace: Fix to ""Variant Conversion"" errors. Now able to print Error Log. Border2 is not required for creating confirmation records nor for creating route data. Include Transmission information in the path when creating confirmation records. The path should resemble: UPSTREAM-SUPPLY-E-TRAN1(OASIS ID)-E-TRAN2(OASIS ID)-E- ... -MARKET-DOWNSTREAM Make Build Route sheet read only to prevent removal of data. Build Routes is dependent on the data staying in the sheet to determine if deals have changed. Add an option to clear the sheet to start over. The transmission deal number is not required for path confirmation records. ""Copy Workspace"" functionality. Allow change font properties (color, bold, etc) and cell properties (highlight color). Allow searching in the sheets. e.g. search for a deal number. A simple search for string or number will do. Neither Upstream nor Downstream are required for path creation. Fix ""General SQL error. ORA-02289: sequence does not exist"" problem. 'Get Now' when repeatedly pressed does not cause application to be unstable Path Confirmation: ? Added preferences for storing and setting the display colors in the grid ? ""Invalid BLOB handle in record buffer "" error is fixed ? Enpower counterparty long names are shown ? Improved loading time while opening path confirmation dialog ? Provided an option confirm the paths in batches, ? Path cut check box indicator is fixed Regards, Will",1
"Here is a snapshot of what is going on right now. It is unusual. According to ISO, they owe us $1MM (instead of us owing them $37MM)!!!!! However, don't take this to the bank since Jan Acton of Charles River Associates believes that the ISO made a significant ""coding"" (ie mathematical formula) error with respect to uninstructed energy, that is behind most of this shift. On the conference call held Monday, others also noticed discrepancies in the uninstructed energy category so it is likely the ISO will discover and fix the error. We suspect there is game playing going on (in addition to errors in the data). CERS went from having to refund $1.2billion, to zero. Also, significant increases (unexplained) in neutrality charges have been observed. ISO asserts their calculations are correct despite the suspected errors and game playing. However, they have not taken mitigation into account for ""spot OOM"" transactions. The magnitude of this is unknown, but could be very large. This makes the correctness of their data even more suspect. Obviously, given the foregoing no one can agree to limit the scope of the proceeding through a stipulation excluding settlement disputes from the proceeding. The numbers are huge as are the shifts or swings in liability with each iteration of new ISO numbers. Absent agreement on the stipulation, Judge Birchman is scheduled to hear oral argument and decide the issue tomorrow. Our main concern will be to keep consideration of issues 2 and 3 (refunds and offsets) together in the procedural schedule. I am meeting with Dan Watkiss at noon to discuss strategy, and Gary Fergus will also be coming in for the hearing. Another conference call with the ISO regarding their data will take place at 2PM. I will follow up with another e-mail so as to keep you posted.",1
"And for July............ It looks like we're missing some volume............ Deal 895651 - baseload deal - should have 55,000 per day allocated. AND in Sitara this deal should be priced at $3.0505.

"Mike, If this making of a list interferes in anyway with the all out effort that we have going on to fix our problem before Monday, I would ask that the list be delayed until after that effort is satisfactory. I am receiving tough calls and I am keeping the wolves at bay, but I can not tell you how bad it will be if we are forced into giving out a bunch of plastic responses on Monday. I have also been contacted by Andy at Moody's and so far I have him calm....but as we all know he is an explosion waiting to happen. I am deeply concerned over this matter.

"In PreSchedule Workspace: What worked: I was still able to successfully copy and paste large amounts of excel data into the PSW. I was able to query build route successfully for each delivery point I needed. I was able to change the color of text and fonts at will. When running the Confirm function: I was able to print the error log, which was helpful when I had to fix a few counterparty errors. The routing speed was still very good. What needs improvement: The run time for the Confirm function is still far too slow to be useful in production. The rockies sheet alone took 2 hours to upload, the Mid C sheet took over two hours. I have not been able to populate the full data set because of this speed issue. I will continue uploading today, and try tomorrow to look at the full data set in confirm. I could not import the Palo Verde sheet in to confirm. I got this error message :ERROR:Access violation at address 004ED7E3 in module 'PreSchedWS.exe'. Read of address 00000000. We need the ability to check for errors before running the sheet, I used another half hour fixing the errors and re-running the sheet. A spot check of routing shows that the routes are still not showing the appropriate flag for physical vs non-physical. Everything shows non-physical. Routing still did not happen on the Northwest Delivered deals that were moved in scheduling to multiple delivery points. Question: Will the sheet support the capability of our transmission legs showing up where the E is now? the weakness with having the path show from transmission 1, 2, etc, is it does not give the POR/POD or the firmness of the transmission. ( The way a path should look is like this: SRP@PV-E-APS(T)PV/WW O#23305 F-WALC(T)WW/MEAD O#464521 MNF-EPMI-NEVP, the way this same path would show if put in to the sheet as it is now will be : SRP@PV-E-APS(23305)-WALC(464521)-NEVP. This is incomplete information.) OR, would it be possible to modify the sheet to accept the following information in the Trans and Oasis number cells? Instead of APS, put APS(T)PV/WW and in the OASIS cell put 23305 F. In Path Confirmation: What worked: I was able to choose and reset colors that help me read the information better. The speed to pull up an individual path is MUCH BETTER. I was able to select a group of paths in the line view and attempt to confirm them. The save takes too long, but it worked. What still needs work: I still cannot sort by Global ID or Tag number. Would a different tag logic work, instead of ""PWX Tag 123"" show ""123 (PWX TAG)?"" Some marketers use letters for tags. The cell with the path in the expanded view must auto-size to contain all of the path. The program needs to insert a dash in the path when each cell boundary is passed.Upstream-Supply-E-Trans-Trans-Trans-Market-Downstream.Right now some run together. The path cut needs work, it is cumbersome, unclear on some entry requirements, and does not seem to recognize any number I put in it. This app seems like guess-work. New path needs work as well. The POR and POD needs to be a type and complete field( like in build route selection) not a first letter drop down list. The Counterparty list is just too confusing and cumbersome to be practical. It should mimic the deal entry list. The new record should be three tiered. Supply first, then market,(both mandatory entry), then transmission as an optional third. To allow a Supply without a Market record is going to create many problems. How are these new records going to be routed? Also, our original intent was that the new path and path cut would drive deal entry, not deal entry being done and then numbers populated into Path Cut. I will continue testing tomorrow, the hotspots I see now are the upload speed to Path confirmation, and a close look at how we need the Path Cut and New Path to work. We are getting there, I am very encouraged! Cara",1

"After speaking with Chris this afternoon I believe the status of the UCSF pricing to be as follows: 1. Chris examined the volumetric data and the pricing information this morning and determined that there was clearly an error that needs to be resolved. It is this error that prevented Chris from delivering a price at the conference call this morning. 2. Given the billing errors that we believe have made in computing the January 2000 - January 2001 payments, Chris does not want to compound these errors by giving UCSF a price for February 2001 - August 2001 based on information that he has determined to be incorrect. 3. Chris can deliver pricing for February 2001 - August 2001 on Monday afternoon but he would like to do with the understanding that this price is to be used solely for internal purposes. If it is necessary to deliver a price to UCSF at Tuesday's meeting, Chris requests that we make it clear that Tuesday's price is a preliminary price. We will need to obtain actualized data from the California ISO before giving UCSF a definitive price. I hope this helps everyone. Unless I hear otherwise I will speak with each of you at 1:30 PST/3:30 CST Monday afternoon. Chris, I apologize in advance if I have in any way misinterpreted our phone call this afternoon.

"Good Afternoon I ran only the Mid Columbia Sheet data for June 23rd. Here are my findings: PreSchedule Workspace: I was forced to choose East or West: good. The error-check feature found the following problems: Incorrectly spelled Counterparty short names Missing Sched term Missing Border 1 Missing Sched Hour Missing Supply or Market Price Missing Supply or Market Cont. Term Missing Time Zone Missing Supply or Market MW Error Check did not see the following errors: Missing Supply OR Market deal numbers Missing Physical or Non-Physical designation During my work, I exited once and decided not to save changes in my MidC sheet. When i re-opened, there was no data on the sheet at all. I re-pasted my sheet data in, but when I tried to execute the build-route query, I got an error message saying ""List index out of bounds (2)"". When I resaved my data, closed and re-opened, my data was there, but when I tried to query build route again, I got the error message ""List index out of bounds (3)"". The confirm seemed to run very quickly, but I found no data populated in the June 23rd date of Path confirmation. Routing took 13 minutes to run, acceptable speed for the amount of paths (all daily and all monthly for MidC). QUESTION: Can we just route the month long bookouts on the first, with the designation of Month in the sched term like we can now? It will cut down on the daily routing. Path Confirmation: Not forced to choose East or West on this: Unable to test this with the new data as none was displayed. I will test as soon as I get word that I can.

"Event Sequence ? Lot 1 of two Sabre auctions went through without issues ? Between Lots, there was a scheduled 15 minute interval. About 10 minutes into this period, developers monitoring the system saw errors showing up on the View Deal page. Within minutes, users reported the same problem reentering the Sabre deal. The rest of the site was unaffected ? Within five minutes, the problem was isolated to the document management subsystem of DealBench. Solution Attempts: ? Restart the process that returns documents ? Move the documents off the deal Solution: ? Create a second deal, same structure as the first, but without the documents. ? The auction on the second Lot started approximately 40 minutes late. Once started, it continued without further errors through several auction extensions, finally resulting in a $500K savings for Sabre. Cause ? Document management process stopped returning documents and was instead returning null values. This caused the View Deal page to appear ""hung"". The Document to be served was the ""deal agent logo"", a special document type that is displayed at the top of the page. Contributing Factors ? The run.bat script, which launches the document management Java process, was not logging its status ? The SQL statement that retrieves the deal agent logo did not correctly handle the special case of a document file being moved. Therefore, moving the deal agent logo to another deal did not solve the error. ? run.bat had never failed previously, and the process had been running consistently for over 60 days. Therefore it was not initially suspected as a problem source. Fixes ? An immediate stop-work on further enhancements to DealBench until system stability has been addressed ? Isolate document management process in the test environment, and thoroughly test all possible failure scenarios. ? Start logging and tracking of run.bat script and document management process ? Make document management process fully redundant, so it will failover in the event of error ? Increase monitoring on new log files ? Initiate an in-depth architectural review with Kevin Montagne's team, to identify further areas to improve system robustness",1
