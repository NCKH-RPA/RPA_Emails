"The next day after my order, I was called from the store to cheat the item and give me information about an expected delivery day. The phone arrived as promised, within 2 days of our phone call. A little surprise was the cost of the courier, 12 BGN at my expense. It is understandable to have such an expense, in the way of the low cost of the apparatus, but this is not clear during the creation of the order. The most unpleasant thing is that there was only a guarantee in the sent documents, without an invoice, without a cash voucher. I asked for an invoice by email, in response to the confirmation of the order, but alas, 9 days after my application, it has not yet been fulfilled. I continue to expect the invoice and the cash voucher for the purchase, and if I do not receive them, I will act the other way.

First, the wheel is different from that of the picture on the site, there is no brake handle, the shade is different and the whole wheel is shaken.

When looking at your wheel, it seems that the break is serious and I do not know how it will be fine. Obviously the product is poorly made.

Secondly, the product I got is faulty one and it is far different from what I saw on the website.

"Perfect service. Like a fluffy, I have a great deal of difficulty in finding the right clothes for myself. The problem is that in the mass stores or models, they are somehow ordinary, or my cuts add even larger volume, or they are sewn, where to keep that there is an asthort for large women. I no longer have a memory of how I came across Fashionchoice.bg, but at the moment I can be defined as a big fan of the store and a regular customer. Their Maxi Fashion tab offers a wide variety of beautiful models, suitable for both everyday life and more special occasions. The description of the size of the clothes on their site helps me greatly with the right choice, and so far there has been no case in which I have to return a purchased garment because of the wrong number. And they have an option to consult an online consultation and I was pleasantly surprised when I asked a question in chat and answered me immediately, ie. Chat in real time. This is huge +for me because it makes it even more easy to shop online. My orders are being executed today for tomorrow, which is great! The prices are extremely good, in my opinion. Although I receive a email confirmation of my order, a very dear lady calls me to confirm all the details. I can write about this store for a long time. The last thing I will say is that for all large ladies who have encountered the horrible inconvenience of looking for clothes - fashionchoice.bg is a really good place to be well dressed and feel beautiful and modern.",Customer Care

"Dear Ms. Hien Hua,

VSP has checked the drawing and had some comments as below:

1. Dimensions IP : 3000x3000 mm . The actual height of the rolling door frame is 2960mm (from the bottom edge of the frame to the floor). Width and other dimensions are the same as shown in the picture, size 3140mm is the width of the roll. The leaves go into the left slot 70, the right slot 70, the inside edge of the left frame to the inside edge of the right frame is 3000mm.

2. The current designed location of motor towing, which cannot be installed due to the available of the tubular cross brace of the truss and the wires and control signal wires. It is recommended to design the traction motor at the bottom right as the old design because there are available locations and connection boxes for power cables and control wires.

Conclusion: The size in the old drawing from 1997 and the actual measured size are the same. It is recommended that the manufacturer should correct the dimensions as in the old drawing (as attached).

P/S: On the left side of the door, there is a steel column 320 mm from the edge of the door, so that, the dimension must strictly follow the old designed for correct installation.

Kindly include the above comments into your drawing and send back to us for approval in soonest.

A few hours later, he called me again to apologize that it was a mistake and that the price was actually 322 leva (in all other stores it was below 200 leva). I decided to look at the store prices and it turned out that everything was huge overvalued by the other companies. Gumbo use a small tariq to record a product with a slightly different name and so in the Pazaruvaj search engine. Com It turns out that the given component is only available to them.

"My name is Yuly, and I am a frequent customer of your business. Unfortunately, I am also a disgruntled customer at the moment. After years of purchasing products from your company, I have grown to trust and rely heavily on your products for my business purposes. 
On July 15 2020, I bought a services from your shop store. I was assured by the sales representative that this product was one of the most reliable products in the store, and if there were any issues, it would be covered by the warranty.
Though this is commonplace for sales representatives to say, it is quite odd that the product would not well work at all once I tried putting it to use. After emailing the store, I was told by the sales representative that I should have tested the product before purchasing it.
As you can imagine, it is quite unreasonable to expect such a large item to be tested in such a small space and in an inappropriate setting. I have written today to demand swift action against this representative and for an exchange of this defective product.
Attached, you will find the transcript of the email correspondence with the sales representative in question. You will also find proof of purchase for this product.
I await your timely response. Thanks,
Yuly.",Customer Care

I would like to put together some quick guidelines for external communications for our group.

"People, do not buy from these cheaters, junk, and bad guys! !
Do not be fooled by the ""appetite"" prices-in the end it will come out slower, more expensive, and you will lose millions of nerves as you try to deal with the pitiful ridiculous and crazy bad guys in this company/site! !
My story is this - I ordered Timberland services, priced at 328 BGN (after a ""discount"" of 380 BGN). I had a specific delivery date and time, which I first wrote in very detailed in the comments about the order. Then I explicitly called their call center to see if they took this information into account because there was nothing in confirmation of the order.
It turned out that they first heard and see such a thing ... I repeated and shook. ""They recorded"". They said they ""handed over to the courier"" (Speedy).
Guess when they sent the delivery? ! It was on this day and time that I had explicitly said I could not. There was a redirection of delivery and a new delay for another 2 days. On the new day and time, they could not supply them again - this time for no Speedy reason. I was at the appointed place, at the appointed hour. There was a new experience and a supply for delivery. This time we hit the couriers. All this time help from obuvki. en - none! !
They leave you to tear your nerves with couriers, Speedy, Medy, etc. After I ordered and paid to obuvki. en I expect you to do all the work and I just get my services without having to turn 20 phone and change the schedules for 1 month to come so I can get my goods.
Finally, the courier came (after 10-12 days), and it turned out that Obuvki dummies. BG have confused the model? !? They had sent me services I didn't want - completely different from what I had ordered.
I call the call center - they were dictated by the right model and color from my original order, that is, the fault is with them. They admitted it. They were extremely rough and brazen, however.
After the altercation, it turned out that they could not replace my wrong model and they could not send me the one I had paid and ordered initially because it was no longer available and was exhausted? !?
10 days of grief, their guilt, and in the end I have neither services nor money! !
I can't even have the services theoretically, as they have exhausted (I wonder if they load 1-2 pairs, after 10 days later it is no longer this model).
I sent a refund request. When I called the call center and ask them if they were morons and why they were so incompetent and they close me ... So I obviously burned with 330 BGN.
Everyone run away from these cheaters and bad guys! !",Customer Care

I am writing to you to voice my deep dissatisfaction with both the quality of goods and service I received at Song Linh shop on Masaryk Street in Brno.
On October 14, I purchased at the above shop a pair of white thick-soled climbing boots at a price of €140.00, with a fifteen-year warranty. I was assured by the shop assistant that the boots are of incomparable quality and comfort, suitable for the most extreme mountain conditions.
Unfortunately, neither quality nor comfort proved to be the case, even though I meticulously followed the instructions for use. First, after one day of light hiking, dark grey stains began to appear on the instep of both boots. Then, in mid-trip, the sole stitching of the left boot came suddenly loose, causing the whole boot to literally fall apart.
Due to this accident, I was forced to cancel my trip to the Alps only two days after I arrived, which has caused me a loss of €1000.00. This is not to mention the massive inconvenience I suffered by having to climb down the mountains with ruined footwear on and thus putting my life and health at serious risk.
I contacted the respective shop immediately after my return to the Czech Republic and demanded a full refund, but was absolutely appalled by the way I was dealt with. The shop assistant flatly refused to return the money, saying that the boots were of different colour than at the time of purchase – i.e. they were no longer pure white - and therefore they could not be regarded as the same goods. At my insistence the shop manager was called in; however, she neither was willing to make a refund and even remarked that I should not have bought climbing boots if I could not wear them properly.
Considering all the nuisance, I think that both a replacement pair of boots and a refund of €400.00 would be an appropriate compensation. I realise that mistakes happen but in my case, the fault on the side of the producer was of great seriousness and, in addition to this, the behaviour of the staff was inexcusable. I've long been a user of Bata’s products and up until now have always considered you to be an excellent organization. I have every faith therefore that you will do what you can to rectify this situation.
I look forward to your reply.
Yours sincerely",Customer Care

"Jeff/Mike, 

I understand there is some concern regarding the take-or-pay exposure under the LNG contracts between DPC and Oman LNG and Adgas. First, there is no direct Enron Corp exposure. Both contracts are between DPC and the related supplier. There are no Corp performance guarantees in either SPA. Attached is a memo sent to Jim Hughes last month outlining the contractural obligations and current discussions with the suppliers. 

From a practical standpoint both suppliers will work with us to reschedule the start dates and to modify the fixed quantities. I met with both suppliers before the holidays and they reconfirmed they will work with Enron as they understand the problems in India. We have delayed the contractual start date under both contracts to the maximum extent possible: February 11, 2002 for Oman and April 30, 2002 for Adgas.

"Event Sequence ? Lot 1 of two Sabre auctions went through without issues ? Between Lots, there was a scheduled 15 minute interval. About 10 minutes into this period, developers monitoring the system saw errors showing up on the View Deal page. Within minutes, users reported the same problem reentering the Sabre deal. The rest of the site was unaffected ? Within five minutes, the problem was isolated to the document management subsystem of DealBench. Solution Attempts: ? Restart the process that returns documents ? Move the documents off the deal Solution: ? Create a second deal, same structure as the first, but without the documents. ? The auction on the second Lot started approximately 40 minutes late. Once started, it continued without further errors through several auction extensions, finally resulting in a $500K savings for Sabre. Cause ? Document management process stopped returning documents and was instead returning null values. This caused the View Deal page to appear ""hung"". The Document to be served was the ""deal agent logo"", a special document type that is displayed at the top of the page. Contributing Factors ? The run.bat script, which launches the document management Java process, was not logging its status ? The SQL statement that retrieves the deal agent logo did not correctly handle the special case of a document file being moved. Therefore, moving the deal agent logo to another deal did not solve the error. ? run.bat had never failed previously, and the process had been running consistently for over 60 days. Therefore it was not initially suspected as a problem source. Fixes ? An immediate stop-work on further enhancements to DealBench until system stability has been addressed ? Isolate document management process in the test environment, and thoroughly test all possible failure scenarios. ? Start logging and tracking of run.bat script and document management process ? Make document management process fully redundant, so it will failover in the event of error ? Increase monitoring on new log files ? Initiate an in-depth architectural review with Kevin Montagne's team, to identify further areas to improve system robustness",Customer Care

"Very incorrect. We organized a meeting to choose guest gifts. The meeting went great. The woman showed us gifts and many other gadgets. But I only liked what I went for - small bottles of rose wine in the form of a heart with a photo of my son. I chose it in advance from their site with a price of 3.70 BGN/pc. When they realized that only I would order, the attitude became different. The price reached BGN 4.30/pc. I said well, 60 pennies are not a problem. I sent the photo for the blame, but did not receive an answer if they accepted the order and whether they would execute it. The next day I saw the photo of my son, which I sent for the gifts on their Facebook page. Without my permission! Anyway, I was silent and called them after 5 days to ask if the gifts were prepared. They were ready. I went to pick them up, but it turned out that the price reached 4.80 or 4,50 leva/ pc! On top of that, they had no resting. Even the wine was not as deep pink as the samples. I am very disappointed. In addition, the day we went for the gifts, I also liked a crown I immediately ordered. It was April 12. The woman said the crown would be in 2-3 days.

"I am very pleased. A few months ago, I accidentally came across this site, before I had never seen it. The site offers services, insoles, pads and fuses, cosmetics and many other legs. My problem was that the right leg knuckle, and the left, was quite protruding aside. In general, this is acquired through the gene and the disease is called Hallux Valgus. If you are caught in the early stages, and prophylactic treatment is applied, the condition can be improved. From the site in question, I ordered a set of tires for both legs that are put at night, thus adjusting the bones on the legs by pressure on the place. I placed the order through the site, having previously looked at a lot of products from their catalog and after requesting my order they approved it the same day. I chose to send it to me to the office of a courier company, I placed the order on Friday, and on Monday I took my bus. The value of the delivery was not large, and I purchased the product for just under BGN 40. I use the two tires every night and in the morning I remove them and a little by little I improve the general condition of my feet. I am pleased because I arrived exactly what was described on the site, I appreciate the correct relationship and that made me a good impression. The woman who called me to confirm the order was very polite and dear. I would order other goods from this site if I needed something in the future.",Customer Care

Normally this is an easy transaction, however they changed their website and it no longer offers exchange as an option. I decided to just return the services and went on to order 2 replacement pairs.

One of them is a pair of services that are identical but only one size different.

The blouse is very nice: the top is white, like a shirt, with a black edging, and the bottom black (type ripsen).

I think this looks good. There is one other area that you may want to include: Develop relationships with governmental agencies that enforce discrimination/affirmative action laws, regulations, and Executive Orders. 

I have been taking the lead on this, with support from Steve Kean and Cindy, but we are just starting the effort this month. Steve and I will meet with the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs this week, and I am hoping to meet with the head of the OFCCP (and, perhaps folks with EEOC in Washington) later in the month. I believe that cordial, cooperative relationships with these agencies can be invaluable in our diversity efforts. 

If you choose to include this activity, it probably would belong in the Communication or Resources sections (it could be included in the section on creation of external relationships). 

Let me know if you have any questions.

In general, there are no traces of use, etc. It looks like new. The other thing I didn't like about the purchase was that the phone arrived with an American or English charger and the battery at 0%, and in the examination and the test in Econt, there was no way to test it, it is well that employees invented from somewhere the iPhone charger to test it.",Customer Care

"The last time I'm shopping there! I used to shop from this store books and generally had no problem.
But this last order was a nightmarish! In early October I ordered a doll for my niece and paid in advance. The site said the doll was available. But after a few days I found out that my order was canceled by an operator because the item was not available. I chose another color, also available to change my order. I was assured that 100% was available to a supplier. Surprise - it is also not available. However, they had a model in different colors. Well, we found one available safely. And after 20 days !!! It was delivered.!
However, our relationship is not over! There was a difference in the price of 3 leva and I refused to document anything from there and should pay me back. For 10 days the amount in question has not been refunded. As my patience is not endless, I will need to be a consumer protection committee. I hope at least they work normally.

I have recently ordered a new pair of soccer cleats (item #6542951) from your website on June 21. I received the order on June 26. Unfortunately, when I opened it, I saw that the cleats were used.

To resolve the problem, I would like you to credit my account for the amount charged for my cleats; I have already went out and bought a new pair of cleats at my local sporting goods store so sending another would result in me having two pairs of the same cleats.

"Dear sales manager,
I am writing to complain about a faulty item that I purchased on your online store on January 3rd, 2019.
The complaint is related to a pair of Song Linh sneakers that arrived with various anomalies. First, when I opened the box, I noticed that one of the pairs didn't have a service pad. Secondly, it was easy to see that the servicelaces were too short. Thirdly, and to my surprise, one of the services was bigger than the other. In fact, one was a size 11 and the other was a size 11and a half. To make things worse, the interior fitting was ripped in both sneakers. I demand a full refund or the replacement of the item that I ordered. I am sure that this matter will receive your prompt attention. I hope to hear from you as soon as possible.

"Dear Sirs,
Children grow so quickly, so of course I never expected my son's services to fall apart before his feet became too large for them. Unfortunately, this was not the case.
I purchased a pair of Skotchers tennis services shortly before the start of this school year in September. Within a month, the rubber sole of the services had begun to detach, rendering the services unsafe for wear as well as visually unpleasing. I've never seen anything like this before. My son is only in kindergarten, and not rough on clothing. The services look like new, expect for the loosely hanging sole.
I have enclosed a photo for your reference. You can clearly see the rubber sole has separated and is hanging loosely to the side.
My entire family has worn Skotchers for years and has never had reason to complain. I expect this is a rare defect, and that there will be no issue with getting a replacement.
While the services still fit my son, I don't know how much longer he will wear a size 9. I am asking that you either (1) replace the services with a pair of the same style in size 10; (2) replace the services with a comparable size 10 tennis service; or (3) refund my total purchase amount of $32.99.
Thank you for your attention to this matter. Please feel free to contact me at 555-555-5555 if you would like more information about the services, or if you would like to provide a postage-paid box or envelope in which I can return them to you..
Appreciatively,
Trully.",Customer Care

"I ordered a promotion vacuum cleaner - it was currently the lowest price on the market. They called me confirmation, the product was delivered on time. The extended warranty and the 14 -day test period are mandatory in the EU, but few Bulgarian companies do so - Bravo on Gumbo. BG! : -)
I would advise the following:
- Try to update the availability on weekends. I ordered on Sunday, the status was that there was one piece, and on Monday it turned out that there were no available and I would have to wait for delivery from abroad. In principle, this is not a problem, but it leaves a slight disappointment in the customer.
- Look for variants of the courier company - from there there was an additional delay because they did not handle the delivery on time.
- I exclude the above, everything else is level and I am pleased!",Customer Care

Dear Mr. Nguyen,

Please note the following updates:

1. 50% payment with order received with thanks and production started.

2. We have the manufacturing drawings for the Wagner R 6.3 rotary vane which was built about 10 years ago. The UHMW Poly seals are very critical and due to variations in the Rotary Vane manufacturing, some adjustments may have to be made during assembly and testing during installation. 

We have offered to send an engineer during installation if required. Note that the system originally included an instruction manual with the equipment which is not available anymore.

The drawings do not include seal dimensions and they vary and occasionally require some adjustment during installation.

3. Clarification: the Purchase Order Pos. nr 38 is shown on the original drawings as a stator vane but this is incorrect. The stator vane is shown on the drawings as Pos. 9 and Pos. 38 is actually a rotor vane. We will be supplying Pos. 38 as a rotor vane seal.

I placed an order for a Christmas gift from Ivet.bg, long before Christmas as the products in particular specific and expensive women's accessory, were labeled and with express delivery (24h).

During the period it had to be delivered, I was informed about more delay and in the end I agreed after they assured me that it would already be delivered in January. But on January 31, after a two -month delay, I was informed that the order would not be fulfilled at all and all my assurances before the gift lady went to hell.

"Dear Song Linh
Thank you for your prompt execution of our order of 25th May. We took the delivery of the consignment today in the morning. The consignment was in perfect order, but to our great surprise we found altogether different service-uppers, however, the soles, belts and jackets were what we had actually ordered.
We had placed order for 500 pairs of service-uppers for men’s services and not for ladies’ services. If you refer again you will find that the service-uppers sent by you don’t correspond with our order no.1234 dated 25th May. The service-uppers for ladies’ services are not required at all by us because there is already a sufficient stock of it with us.
Evidently wrong items have been sent to us and it has caused as a great inconvenience as we have many urgent order for men’s services only.

Promotion and lenses, together with the solution and bonus, a small solution came out just under 40lv. I gave up quarterly lenses, one of which came out to me 11lv, choosing a diopter and curvature of the lens itself. And to the solution I chose had an additional gift- Mini solution, which is very convenient for the road. As a whole on the site you can easily navigate how to order.

"Dear Ms. Hien Hua,

Thank you very much for your information.

As you know, we has signed the contract with our customer that delivery time is 16 weeks from contract signing (20 July 2022). It means that deadline for delivery is 9 November 2022.

PO also signed with Kaefer that delivery time is 20 weeks from complete of commercial, technical clarification and approval of final drawing (dated 25/08/2022). The delivery time should be 12 January 2023. If including transportation time taken about 1 month, the delivery date should be 12 February 2023 which is 15 weeks late compare with delivery deadline in the contract with VSP.

We understand the difficulty of your company. However, in revert, you should understand our commitment that if good is delivery late 7 weeks, 8% contract value will be applied as penalty. If good is delivery late more than 60 days, VSP can cancel the contract and applied 8% contract value penalty.

Based on the above information, Song Linh would like to seek KAEFER cooperation to shorten delivery time as much as possible less than PO signed between Song Linh and Kaefer. Song Linh has worked hard to build the expectation from VSP by providing goods with right specification and quality by the right time as signed in contract. Thus, we do hope that Kaefer could help us maintains our image of 14 years good performance.

Thank you and look forward to receive Kaefer’s cooperation on this situation.

"Here is a snapshot of what is going on right now. It is unusual. According to ISO, they owe us $1MM (instead of us owing them $37MM)!!!!! However, don't take this to the bank since Jan Acton of Charles River Associates believes that the ISO made a significant ""coding"" (ie mathematical formula) error with respect to uninstructed energy, that is behind most of this shift. On the conference call held Monday, others also noticed discrepancies in the uninstructed energy category so it is likely the ISO will discover and fix the error. We suspect there is game playing going on (in addition to errors in the data). CERS went from having to refund $1.2billion, to zero. Also, significant increases (unexplained) in neutrality charges have been observed. ISO asserts their calculations are correct despite the suspected errors and game playing. However, they have not taken mitigation into account for ""spot OOM"" transactions. The magnitude of this is unknown, but could be very large. This makes the correctness of their data even more suspect. Obviously, given the foregoing no one can agree to limit the scope of the proceeding through a stipulation excluding settlement disputes from the proceeding. The numbers are huge as are the shifts or swings in liability with each iteration of new ISO numbers. Absent agreement on the stipulation, Judge Birchman is scheduled to hear oral argument and decide the issue tomorrow. Our main concern will be to keep consideration of issues 2 and 3 (refunds and offsets) together in the procedural schedule. I am meeting with Dan Watkiss at noon to discuss strategy, and Gary Fergus will also be coming in for the hearing. Another conference call with the ISO regarding their data will take place at 2PM.

"Richard, etal --

Attached is the complaint that EES intends to file tomorrow against SCE related to the recoupment of our Negative CTC. As you aware, after returning our customers to DA recently, our billing department was expecting that the past Negative CTCs would be returned to our customer's accounts - this has not happened nor after conversations with SCE will it occur. 

This complaint is the next step in the process of attempting to recoup these funds. Primarily EES does not want to pay for Utility charges for our customers while an outstanding Negative CTC balance is due.

One key risk with filing this Complaint is that SCE may consolidate this case with the earlier Complaint that is currently on hold. Probably not too big of a downside.

We will be paying the bills into the CPUC for holding until the resolution of the Complaint.

Any questions or issues please let me know.

I have sent along for your review, the supporting documentation from both Moody's and S&P regarding the Aquila credit rating, the Secretary of State filing/order showing Aquila's name change, our underlying contract and a proposed amendment for your review/execution. 

It appears that this amendment is necessary because there has been a delay in the execution of a new contract which would have removed UtiliCorp as a party.

"Shopping as such was fast and hassle -free. Delivery too. On the other hand, the site trades in medical devices that are quite specific and unfortunately the return policy is still a type of ""fortress peasant"" - that is, I can return the purchase if it is not unpacked. This is quite dishonest for this type of product because it may not have purchased the right product or it is something different from what I expected. In this case, the pillow in question is extremely uncomfortable, although I insist on using it for the 10th day. After checking the conditions for the return, I decided it was not worth the nerves and efforts and I would just dump it into the basement. In the whole normal world, when you buy a similar product and it is not what you expect is not supposed to have difficulty but just return it. I repeat that I have not made an explicit experience to make it because I respect the rules and after I have ordered I was expected to know what the terms of return are. But how the hell do I test a sitting pillow without unpacking it? ??

The site looked the most complete as an assortment and offered free shipping.

"Many original ideas for occasions and holidays. We recently organized a baptism of my nephew, which turns 1 hour. One of the guests had ordered a whole box of chocolate from this site as a gift for baptism. For the first time, I saw such interesting chocolates- on one side the date of baptism was discharged and on the other- there was a picture of the child. In addition, the chocolate was very tasty- they liked this delicious surprise very much. I asked a little girl who had ordered the chocolates and she told me that she was very pleased with the policy of this site a shock party and that their prices were very acceptable. This site has chocolates and delicious surprises for Christmas, Valentine's Day, Baptism, Birthdays and Weddings.

"Good Afternoon I ran only the Mid Columbia Sheet data for June 23rd. Here are my findings: PreSchedule Workspace: I was forced to choose East or West: good. The error-check feature found the following problems: Incorrectly spelled Counterparty short names Missing Sched term Missing Border 1 Missing Sched Hour Missing Supply or Market Price Missing Supply or Market Cont. Term Missing Time Zone Missing Supply or Market MW Error Check did not see the following errors: Missing Supply OR Market deal numbers Missing Physical or Non-Physical designation During my work, I exited once and decided not to save changes in my MidC sheet. When i re-opened, there was no data on the sheet at all. I re-pasted my sheet data in, but when I tried to execute the build-route query, I got an error message saying ""List index out of bounds (2)"". When I resaved my data, closed and re-opened, my data was there, but when I tried to query build route again, I got the error message ""List index out of bounds (3)"". The confirm seemed to run very quickly, but I found no data populated in the June 23rd date of Path confirmation. Routing took 13 minutes to run, acceptable speed for the amount of paths (all daily and all monthly for MidC). QUESTION: Can we just route the month long bookouts on the first, with the designation of Month in the sched term like we can now? It will cut down on the daily routing. Path Confirmation: Not forced to choose East or West on this: Unable to test this with the new data as none was displayed. I will test as soon as I get word that I can.

Delivery time start from complete commercial and technical clarification (after
approval of technical drawing).
CW 51/2022and CW 52/2022 does not count for the delivery time because our
office will be closed during holiday time. Kaefer quotation is 14-16 weeks Ex-works. Thus, we have signed the contract with VSP by 18 July 2022 with 4,5 months delivery which is already very tight for us.

VSP will applied penalty when late on delivery as following: “If Party B's delivery is delayed, Party B will be fined as follows: 1%/week for the first 04 weeks of delay; fine 1.5%/week for the following weeks calculated on the value of the whole group of items with late delivery until the total fine does not exceed 8% of the value of the group of goods with the violated item.”

Thus, please keep the original offer of 14-16 weeks. It was an old quotation which is not valid anymore. You can see the validity on each quotation. 
I am sorry but as you also can see on the quotation the delivery time start from complete commercial and technical clarification. We have not promised the delivery time. Sorry it is not possible to reduce the delivery time. 

No contract has yet been concluded between Solicom and KAEFER Bremen.

The delivery time right now is 20 -26 weeks. 

Understanding the validity on your quotation. However, there is a complicated issue occurred on this tender that extending the bidding time. Song Linh is the first one who worked with Kaefer on this tender. We have spent so much time and effort to work with Kaefer to convince VSP to order the full Fire Roller Shutter in stead of just buying some components for replacing the damaged one.

All of the above made the delay in time. With our business reputation, Song Linh will continue the contract with VSP on delivery of 4,5 months. If Kaefer could not support us on delivery time, Song Linh will be applied 8% of contract value due to delay delivery. It seems that our effort to supply Kaefer product to customer, in return, we get some lost.

Please understanding our position and provide your best support.

"Waste of time. Some time ago, when I was maternity with the older child (6-7 years ago), I found a seller. At that time, the users on the site were small, mostly mothers whose purpose was to sell the already lunched clothes to children to buy new ones. There were not as many scammers and incorrect users on the site as it is now. It was at the Seller that I made new friendships that we still maintain to this day.
I bought some things and I was pleased. I bought it through a seller of the child.
Now the idea of ??a seller is quite different. About 2 years ago, the owners of the site changed and there was a place for traders, not for mothers, as was the original idea. Now I wouldn't shop from there - the prices are the same as in shops (even more expensive), as I pay the courier service .... The meaning of the seller is lost .... I go more and kill for a while ...

But I am sorry that it is very difficult to consider that discount ratio in this offer. 
It will be really great if we can put more than 15% margin and can offer the discount as you want. 
But actually the manufacturers never expect that high profit generally and really difficult to absorb that rate from our side only. 

For the first cooperation, I would like to make the total amount $20,000 to support you. 
I’d appreciate if you check and confirm soon.

"Reduced goods are branded and really profitable. The manuals help a lot in the choice. Delivery is correct. Convenient and fast use site. I particularly like the ""promotion"" category, where there are huge reductions in otherwise ungodly expensive goods, such as baby strollers. The assortment of baby clothes is slightly fasting - I would have more colors and socks. Bandans and booms are OK, the variety is great there. The biggest advantage is the so-called. ""Manuals"" that direct you which product to buy according to your needs. It was helpful for me to read about different types of breastfeeding pumps. As a minus, as in most online stores, I can point out that there is no showroom that is not cool when ordering blind products for 800+ BGN.

2. Also please see below : for SS valves factory have only solenoid connection *M* with multicertification. NPT solenoid connection is the one available with valve type /UL (cULus certification). 
Also please note factory have cable glands in SS only for *M* solenoid connections, not for NPT. If NPT is required it is necessary that you will find them in local market. 
Is it possible for your customer to switch to *M* connection so that we provide the std multicertified valve along with SS cable glands? Factory would propose (if ok for customer application) DHAX4-0713/M 24DC , to be completed with info about water or mineral oil

4 Approx. 20 weeks.
Delivery time start from complete commercial and technical clarification (after
approval of technical drawing).
CW 51/2022and CW 52/2022 does not count for the delivery time because our
office will be closed during holiday time. Kaefer quotation is 14-16 weeks Ex-works. Thus, we have signed the contract with VSP by 18 July 2022 with 4,5 months delivery which is already very tight for us.

VSP will applied penalty when late on delivery as following: “If Party B's delivery is delayed, Party B will be fined as follows: 1%/week for the first 04 weeks of delay; fine 1.5%/week for the following weeks calculated on the value of the whole group of items with late delivery until the total fine does not exceed 8% of the value of the group of goods with the violated item.”

Thus, please keep the original offer of 14-16 weeks. It was an old quotation which is not valid anymore. You can see the validity on each quotation. 
I am sorry but as you also can see on the quotation the delivery time start from complete commercial and technical clarification. We have not promised the delivery time. Sorry it is not possible to reduce the delivery time. 

No contract has yet been concluded between Solicom and KAEFER Bremen.

The delivery time right now is 20 -26 weeks. 

Understanding the validity on your quotation. However, there is a complicated issue occurred on this tender that extending the bidding time. Song Linh is the first one who worked with Kaefer on this tender. We have spent so much time and effort to work with Kaefer to convince VSP to order the full Fire Roller Shutter in stead of just buying some components for replacing the damaged one.

All of the above made the delay in time. With our business reputation, Song Linh will continue the contract with VSP on delivery of 4,5 months. If Kaefer could not support us on delivery time, Song Linh will be applied 8% of contract value due to delay delivery. It seems that our effort to supply Kaefer product to customer, in return, we get some lost.

Please understanding our position and provide your best support. I can understand your situation and I am very sorry. Thank you for your efforts but we cannot change the delivery times. We have always been honest about the delivery times.

If there is any chance to shorten the delivery time we will let you know.

But right now it is 20 -26 weeks. 

5 Article 7: Accepted - Noted. -

"Great products and service. I am extremely pleased with my latest purchases in the online store Shosho.bg. Since I am extremely concerned about my children wear, first and foremost, comfortable clothes, I keep the cuts perfect and the fabrics are naturally natural. I have two boys, one is a first-grader and for the beginning of the school year we bought a lot of clothes from different stores, but I was most pleased with the jeans purchased from Shosho, with the jeans there is a brown knit belt. First, communication with the site was very easy, extremely responsive. We had to change one pants because we didn't get the numbers, no problem, which is very important to me. Of course, the most important was the quality, and it was impeccable as a cut and in matter.",Customer Care

"After speaking with Chris this afternoon I believe the status of the UCSF pricing to be as follows: 1. Chris examined the volumetric data and the pricing information this morning and determined that there was clearly an error that needs to be resolved. It is this error that prevented Chris from delivering a price at the conference call this morning. 2. Given the billing errors that we believe have made in computing the January 2000 - January 2001 payments, Chris does not want to compound these errors by giving UCSF a price for February 2001 - August 2001 based on information that he has determined to be incorrect. 3. Chris can deliver pricing for February 2001 - August 2001 on Monday afternoon but he would like to do with the understanding that this price is to be used solely for internal purposes. If it is necessary to deliver a price to UCSF at Tuesday's meeting, Chris requests that we make it clear that Tuesday's price is a preliminary price. We will need to obtain actualized data from the California ISO before giving UCSF a definitive price. I hope this helps everyone. Unless I hear otherwise I will speak with each of you at 1:30 PST/3:30 CST Monday afternoon. Chris, I apologize in advance if I have in any way misinterpreted our phone call this afternoon.

"It's going on. In my opinion, it comes out a little expensive to shop from an online pharmacy, because it was in this one that I compared prices there and prices in other pharmacies that are not online and with lion or two higher, and there is a price for delivery that It makes them more expensive. Otherwise, it is well loaded, for absolutely every medicine or cosmetics has a very detailed and good description, an up -to -date photo of the product and encyclopedia.

"Dear Sir/Madam,
I had bought the following product of your company from a shop in HCM. I am very disappointed to say that my legitimate warranty claim has not been honored.
(i) Name of the Product: Sneaker
Date of the Purchase: 2/3/2022
Address & Telephone No.: HCM & 562-521-523 
(ii) Brand: (v) Amount Paid: Song Linh (v) 500$
Within days of buying your product, it started showing technical problems. It seems like a manufacturing default in the product. I went to the shop where I had bought the product and I conveyed to the shop owner/manager the problems with the product.
After showing him the warranty card, I had requested him to have the product repaired or replaced so that I can get a fully functioning product without any faults in it. I was shocked to notice that the shop owner/manager abused me in front of everyone present and rejected my genuine claim.
Therefore, I kindly request your goodself to look into the issue and provide me with a solution as soon as possible. I am enclosing herewith a copy of the purchase invoice and warranty card for your kind reference.

"In PreSchedule Workspace: What worked: I was still able to successfully copy and paste large amounts of excel data into the PSW. I was able to query build route successfully for each delivery point I needed. I was able to change the color of text and fonts at will. When running the Confirm function: I was able to print the error log, which was helpful when I had to fix a few counterparty errors. The routing speed was still very good. What needs improvement: The run time for the Confirm function is still far too slow to be useful in production. The rockies sheet alone took 2 hours to upload, the Mid C sheet took over two hours. I have not been able to populate the full data set because of this speed issue. I will continue uploading today, and try tomorrow to look at the full data set in confirm. I could not import the Palo Verde sheet in to confirm. I got this error message :ERROR:Access violation at address 004ED7E3 in module 'PreSchedWS.exe'. Read of address 00000000. We need the ability to check for errors before running the sheet, I used another half hour fixing the errors and re-running the sheet. A spot check of routing shows that the routes are still not showing the appropriate flag for physical vs non-physical. Everything shows non-physical. Routing still did not happen on the Northwest Delivered deals that were moved in scheduling to multiple delivery points. Question: Will the sheet support the capability of our transmission legs showing up where the E is now? the weakness with having the path show from transmission 1, 2, etc, is it does not give the POR/POD or the firmness of the transmission. ( The way a path should look is like this: SRP@PV-E-APS(T)PV/WW O#23305 F-WALC(T)WW/MEAD O#464521 MNF-EPMI-NEVP, the way this same path would show if put in to the sheet as it is now will be : SRP@PV-E-APS(23305)-WALC(464521)-NEVP. This is incomplete information.) OR, would it be possible to modify the sheet to accept the following information in the Trans and Oasis number cells? Instead of APS, put APS(T)PV/WW and in the OASIS cell put 23305 F. In Path Confirmation: What worked: I was able to choose and reset colors that help me read the information better. The speed to pull up an individual path is MUCH BETTER. I was able to select a group of paths in the line view and attempt to confirm them. The save takes too long, but it worked. What still needs work: I still cannot sort by Global ID or Tag number. Would a different tag logic work, instead of ""PWX Tag 123"" show ""123 (PWX TAG)?"" Some marketers use letters for tags. The cell with the path in the expanded view must auto-size to contain all of the path. The program needs to insert a dash in the path when each cell boundary is passed.Upstream-Supply-E-Trans-Trans-Trans-Market-Downstream.Right now some run together. The path cut needs work, it is cumbersome, unclear on some entry requirements, and does not seem to recognize any number I put in it. This app seems like guess-work. New path needs work as well. The POR and POD needs to be a type and complete field( like in build route selection) not a first letter drop down list. The Counterparty list is just too confusing and cumbersome to be practical. It should mimic the deal entry list. The new record should be three tiered. Supply first, then market,(both mandatory entry), then transmission as an optional third. To allow a Supply without a Market record is going to create many problems. How are these new records going to be routed? Also, our original intent was that the new path and path cut would drive deal entry, not deal entry being done and then numbers populated into Path Cut. I will continue testing tomorrow, the hotspots I see now are the upload speed to Path confirmation, and a close look at how we need the Path Cut and New Path to work. We are getting there, I am very encouraged! Cara",Customer Care

"Dear Mr. Penn,
I have been a loyal customer of your service center for the past five years. However I am writing this letter to file a complaint against the unsatisfactory services that the store has been providing for the past few months.
From the past few visits, I feel that the attendees present in the shop firstly ignore the customers and then behave rudely when they ask for any item. I visited your service store on 25th June, 2014 and found myself standing for ten minutes before one of the attendees approached me to know my needs. When I asked him for the item I needed, he showed me one or two varieties which I did not like. Soon after my denial to these varieties, he started getting annoyed and spoke rudely.
I have been visiting your shop for many years but have never experienced such a behavior from your previous staff. Kindly pay attention to my complaint and look into this matter as soon as possible as this kind of behavior is not at all acceptable.
Sincerely,
Sarah Parker.",Customer Care

"Satisfied. I shopped from this baby clothes store some time ago and I was pleased with everything! The clothes are really very quality, imported from England and are 100% original. It worried me the first time I was shopping if they would really be original, as it was written, but everything turned out to be OK. They are imported from there and they sell them here, but the markings are quite large. If you compare the prices, you will see, but if you have the opportunity to shop from English sites, it is worth it because there are many poor quality clothes in stores at the same prices. Otherwise the range is very diverse, the dimensions are quite well described, but to some brands, such as Madar Kerr, I bought body and pajamas, the dimensions are quite enlarged, but the quality is once. The good thing is that it is paid at delivery and so one feels more relaxed, especially the first time. The client may decide that it is also convenient to pay with a card, but they do not have this option. They are fast with delivery, they meet the deadlines, as they described it in the ""Supply"" option. I recommend it for shopping!",Customer Care

I am a Master's student at Texas A&M University. I met with Paula Rieker of Investor Relations at Enron last Wednesday during the presentation she gave in the College of Business at Texas A&M. I have been interested in Enron for some time, and Ms. Rieker's presentation impressed me even further.

She was kind enough to provide me with your name and phone number as a contact person. I have a Bachelor's degree in Government from The University of Texas at Austin. I feel that the combination of my undergraduate government degree and the graduate degree in marketing that I am currently pursuing makes government relations an ideal area for me.

Sometimes the prices of clothes are very reduced. Last year, they had blouses and tank tops for 5 leva each, but their quality is not good. I ordered reduced clothes and it's not much worth it. Otherwise they have very expensive models. They have great dresses. I once ordered a dress from there. It was about BGN 40, but I was definitely pleased. The truth is that I am already booked to their reduced models. I cannot deny that they offer many types of clothing. Their range is definitely very rich. I like their service.

Approving technical drawings).
CW 51/2022and CW 52/2022 is not counted for delivery time because
The office will close during the holiday period. The Kaefer quotation is 14-16 old working weeks. Therefore, we signed a contract with VSP on July 18, 2022 with 4.5 months of delivery that was very tight for us.

VSP will apply the penalty when delayed delivery is as follows: If Party B's delivery is delayed, Party B will be fined as follows: 1%/week for the first 04 weeks delayed; A fine of 1.5%/week in the following weeks is calculated according to the value of the entire group of items with late delivery until the total fine is not exceeding 8% of the value of the goods group with the item. violate.

Therefore, please keep the initial proposal of 14-16 weeks. It is an old quote that is no longer valid. You can see the validity of each quote.
I'm sorry, but as you can see on quotes, delivery time starts from completely clarifying trade and techniques. We did not promise the delivery time. Sorry, cannot reduce delivery time.

No contract has ended between Solicom and Kaefer Bremen.

Delivery time is now 20 -26 weeks.

Understand the validity of your citation. However, there is a complicated problem that happened on this bidding to extend the bidding period. Song Linh was the first to work with Kaefer on this bidding. We spent a lot of time and effort to work with Kaefer to persuade VSP to order a fire shutter instead of buying only some components to replace the damaged.

All of the above have made the delay in time. With our business reputation, Song Linh will continue to contract with VSP when delivering 4.5 months. If Kaefer cannot support us at delivery time, but Linh will apply 8% of the contract value due to delayed delivery. It seems that our efforts to provide Kaefer products to our customers, we lost.

Please understand our position and provide your best support. I can understand your situation and I am very sorry. Thank you for your efforts but we cannot change the delivery time. We are always honest about delivery time.

If there is any chance to shorten the delivery time, we will let you know.

But right now is 20-26 weeks.

5 Article 7: Accepted - Note. -
6 Article 8: Accepted - Note. -
7 Article 10: This returns the time limit back to our customer contract as talked in section 4. However, Song Linh can accept this comment and want Kaefer to keep the initial incentive of you OK

"They raised prices and quality is not good. I regularly shopped from the site 3 years ago, then I often made big orders, but the models were increasingly not satisfying me. The cuts have not been fashionable for a long time. They do not fit the dimensions that they themselves have given. They raised a lot of prices. A simple knit blouse can cost $ 49. But worse is that almost all zippers break down on first-second wear. The fabrics are also not of good quality, whiten, they are flooded. A bag that was declared Italian was Chinese and peeled quickly. I soon lied to order again and noticed that they had become ""retail tariq"" about delivery. They did not read me the size insurance.

I ordered the latest model of Song Linh brand, services, red colour through your web-site. Since, 15th June was a Black Friday and discount of twenty-five percent was ongoing on this particular item which was affordable for me, I immediately placed the order. I thought that it would be an excellent birthday present for my mother.
I checked the selling policy and terms regarding delivery, it was quite clear that this services will be delivered within 5 working days and it was suitable for me because the birthday of my mother was after a week. However, I have received the services only yesterday when my mother’s birthday has already passed. I kindly request you to return me my money mainly because of this late delivery, I had to buy a new services from the market and obviously, I do not need this extra services.
Hope you will understand my situation and transfer the money back. In my turn/Besides, I am ready to bear all responsibilities and financial expenses for ensuring the safe return of this device. I have not opened the packaging and will send it as it was originally packed.

"The Manager,
We bought running services from Song Linh. It's not even been a year now and the pasting of the services has come out completely from all sides.
The services are not up to the mark the way the pasting has come out from all sides. I would request a replacement for my services at the earliest possible as they are torn off and the pasting has come out from all sides which is a ""Black Spot"" for such an expensive brand like Song Linh as repairing or servicing the services won't serve the purpose. We don't expect such quality services from a company like Song Linh after paying so much. We would rather request people not to buy services from a company like Song Linh where the quality of services is so poor that it does not even last for one year even after you spend so much.

"Xiaomi Redmi 4X I wanted and ordered you on Friday night. It is a huge disadvantage that you do not find 1 person on Saturday to go to process by noon, for example, orders, which have gathered from Friday afternoon to Saturday. You have released this model with 3 different stores, but the telelon is one. Do you have your customers so much for idiots? Of course, you don't have this model available, because there is such a price only in eBay. Your operator tried to try my ""newer model"". Come on, no need. I have looked at the models so I want someone specifically. The fact that you do not reflect that there is no availability of the model is deliberate to attract customers, I am convinced.

"Hello, in advance, the price for the official import plan.
The unit price of 1 unit is 500 thousand VND excluding VAT, plus dangerous shipping + partial shipment is 650 EUR / 1 lot under 10kg, excluding VAT. The cost of dangerous shipping + partial shipment will be added to the price of the goods.
This direction usually applies to the case of stocking hundreds of batteries and sharing this 650 EUR fee for 100 units is more feasible, currently I still apply the stock form for the S7-400 Battery and share this fee.

"I ordered boots on May 24, 2017, when there was a discount. They cost $ 207 with the discount of Fly London. They arrived with a baked sole. I called the phone and recommended that I send them with the claim form because I was carrying them for an hour or two in the office. The sole is embossed and at the initial inspection it is not noticed that it is bored. I returned them and waited a month of answer. On 05/01/2018, I received an answer that the manufacturer accepts my claim, they will repair them and return them to me. Despite my categorical refusal to get repaired boots that arrived with a defect, they refused to return my money. I am now waiting for the repaired boots that are not known when they will arrive.
A few months ago, I ordered a backpack, which also arrived with a factory defect. The skin was cut in two places. I am outraged by the incorrect attitude. None of the emails and the messages I sent did not receive an answer.",Customer Care

"Dear Ambassador Merrill, 

I understand that you and Betsy Ginsberg had a conversation at reunion last month about a possible partnership between the Fletcher School and Enron. Thank you for generously 
offering to help us explore this connection. We believe there are strong synergies between Professor Bill Moomaw's 
International Environment and Resource Policy program and Enron's business model. There is currently a strong recruiting relationship between Enron and Fletcher; there are nine Fletcherites at Enron at this time. I'm confident that our strong recruiting relationship is a solid first step from which to launch an even stronger partnership. 

In order to explore expanding this relationship Ms. Elise Kalmans, Director of Community Development, agreed to arrange a meeting for Bill and me last spring. Unfortunately, the scheduling did not work out, and Ms. Kalmans then began a maternity leave so we had trouble identifying a new 
point of contact. 

I appreciate your suggestion that we aim to work through Stephen Kean. As Senior Vice President for Public and Environmental and Government Affairs, he does sound like the ideal contact with whom to discuss Professor Moomaw's program and its students. How do you suggest we proceed? Should we send a letter from Interim Dean Trachtman to ask if Mr. Kean would be willing to meet with Professor Moomaw? May I mention that you suggested we write him? 

At Betsy's suggestion, I have attached the presentation outline we prepared for Enron, along with the letter we originally mailed to Elise. I would be very interested in any suggestions you may have. If you have any trouble opening the powerpoint file or word document, please let me know and I would be happy to mail or fax them. Thank you again for your kind offer of assistance.

"Have a nice shop with nice baby services. I found this shop accidentally looking for services for my little daughter, and specifically at this company Bart. Because I had bought their mall services, but they turned out to be small, they were the last number and they couldn't replace them. I decided to see if they had a representative store. It turned out that their store has a great variety of baby and baby services and prices are more than normal. When reduced, they even range from nine levs to twenty levs. The quality of the services themselves is relatively good. I have no specific remarks about ours. Only some models for me at least the numbering goes a little. I think they are reduced by one number. The models are very interesting and would satisfy any taste. The good thing is that they have a guarantee and an option to return and replace within seven days, if I'm not mistaken. In addition to services that I was particularly interested in, there are also clothes, toys and other baby and baby goods. There is something to buy at all. Unfortunately, they had also done the model we wanted because it had been a collection. In the end, we bought another model.",Customer Care

After much thought and reading contradictory opinions on the Internet, I decided to take the risk and ordered two perfumes and decorative cosmetics from the enzo.bg website, because the prices were quite tempting. I put the order and waited. It should be noted that they were slightly slow with the processing and - for 4 days. Even after I received the ordered, there remained a doubt about the originality of the products, so I went to the mall, scattered from the perfumes in the store on one hand. After I came out, I scattered from those from Enzo.bg to the other. Well, I have to tell you that there was no difference in the aroma or in durability.

"Good service. With my first order from this site, I had a payment problem. Since I used a credit card and their system obviously had collapsed, it didn't show me if the payment had been made! I wrote them in the mail and the next day their employee immediately contacted me. It turned out that there was really some problem with their system. Because the offer was expiring, it was important to pay to receive the products. After a few telephone conversations and a few unsuccessful attempts to pay the staff at the end, the employees came up with another option: paying through Pei Pal without registering! I am fascinated by a lot of their attitude - the payment has been made and I am very pleased! The fact is that some of their offers are very expensive, but there are more accessible!",Customer Care

"As most of us have discussed, Harry Arora's group has been developing an e-commerce site now known as DealBench.com (formerly EnronDirectFinance). This site is being launched as an information dissemination/deal platform whose closest competitor is Intralinks. DealBench's customers will be banks, 
law firms, and other businesses who desire a secure internet platform to conduct business transactions online. Customers will license use of the site pursuant to written agreements. Several trademark applications have been filed by Enron Corp. for the site. Lawyers from Vinson & Elkins in Austin (Bob Baird and Dean Harvey) and Houston (Steve Borgman) have been assisting us in various legal matters relating to the site. 

At this point, the commercial team desires to move ahead with a limited liability entity to own and operate the DealBench business. Based upon input from many of you, the proposal is to form a simple, single-member, owner-managed Delaware limited liability company named DealBench L.L.C. he sole owner would be Enron Net Works LLC. Upon formation, all assets and liabilities of the DealBench business will be assigned to, and assumed by the new LLC. We understand that the private placement being contemplated by Net Works will be through a separate legal entity and currently does not 
contemplate the DealBench business. We also understand that DealBench's ownership by Net Works will not preclude future flexibility in DealBench's ownership. 

The commercial team desires to move forward with formation of DealBench L.L.C. this week. Based upon your input, we will proceed as outlined above. If you have any other thoughts or suggestions, please let me know. Thanks for your help.

I keep the services in their original form aside and gladly return the stationery with the necessary modifications under a separate cover. I would appreciate it if you send me the proper stationery ASAP.
In addition, I hope you will credit my account with $50 for the cost of returning the stationery. If you arrange the return by your company, I have no problem at all. Just let me know about it, and I won't take the initiative to return my own product.
Note; I will be forced to sue your store if I don't get a response from you within the next seven days regarding the box replacement.
I hope not to encounter this kind of difficulty any more. Thank you and look forward to your attention on this matter to resolve it quickly.

The first time I ordered a black phone, but they had sent me a gray, the phone was a gift so it wasn't a big problem, but it's still disappointing.
The second time I ordered again as a gift, the day was Monday morning, and I would give the phone on Thursday night. After a conversation, the lady I talked to on the phone assured me that the phone would be with me on Wednesday. Well, there was no delivery on Wednesday, even on Thursday it didn't come, I received it on Friday. Extremely disappointed! !
Summary: A customer is hard to win and very easily lost this way, and the store has many more to learn

Just one advantage: the low price of the phones.

Extremely bad communication! ! ! !
Don't answer phone calls! !
Don't return a call! !

I paid the value of the courier's blouse and decided not to return the item to them, but the truth is that I was not fascinated by what happened.

"HM definitely have no rich assortment. They have the same things, cloned a hundred times, thus creating the illusion that the store almost sends out of goods. For example, their Petite section is very bad if they can be said at all that they have such a section. The shop is a bucket of uniform goods. Jeans, pants - none of the right length. Blouses - always wide, long. It is full of low -quality knitwear for 20 BGN. It is wedges, blouses, dresses, cheap leotard sunshines, which loses its shape after the first washing. The price does not justify the quality! The limit of Low Cost and Middle/High End products is blurred. You never know if the blazer of 59 leva will not be torn in a month or the fanel for 19.99 will outlive the blazer. I mentioned that they did not have different types of pants according to the different lengths of the inner edge of the legs, and of course, different cuts. In HM everything is skinny, skinny, skinny. If there is a different model, it will either be long and wide or will not exist. The accessories remain the only option, but still have inflated prices that do not justify their quality. You cannot give 9.99 for some sheet metal rings. It's just unacceptable. For me, this is a store for exalted teenage girls who are still whether the goods will be of quality or not - the important thing is to be collar, and of course, for people with deep pockets who want to waste their money. Because HM is far from what is being made - in Europe it may be Customer Class, but in Bulgaria it is well above the middle class users. Separately, 80% of their products can only be worn by models, and after a lot of photoshop. Yes, I also bought good things from HM. But after hours of digging, testing, searching, hours and hours of exhaustion. In principle, I like to shop, but if I go into HM, it becomes torture. The store is also poorly organized, but it depends on the staff. Overall, my appreciation for this store is negative.",Customer Care

"They make good promotions. I often shop from emag.bg, mainly because the delivery is free and usually the order arrives the next day. I shop mostly cosmetics for the family and diapers for the child, but I also ordered the technique many times - I bought from there a vacuum cleaner, telephone, camera and others, and so far I have not had a problem with the sent product, except for a non -working toy I had with whom I had And a lot of return headaches, they even had to take over transport costs, as the product was offered by their partner, and they had a different policy for returning the products. There is something to be desired by the range, but they are constantly expanding it by adding new categories and products. What I am not satisfied with is the lack of feedback with the client - it happened not to receive a response to both inquiry and complaints, as well as that they censor the comments of their products if they are not only superlatives in them S",Customer Care

"Cara et all, Following list of bug fixes are moving out to stage to address the recently reported issues: New versions of both applications have been moved out to stage..

Solution: Line 69 , the timezone value under column G was '6/20/2001-6/20/2001' when it should have been 'PDT' or any other valid timezone value. #2 Problem: Running Build Route Report: Criteria Selection-unable to select criteria for build route, got ""List index out of bounds (4)"" error *needs fix Solution: Fixed.. was losing track of which workspace was open #3 Problem: Daily Summary Function *needs fix or workaround-Would not work at all, got 3 error messages. "" Unable to locate"" ""can't find last row!"", and ""Failed to export summary!"" this is going to create a csv file right to the AGG sched vol report now according to Mr. Poston, I am thrilled to hear it. Solution: Executive Report was just pushed to stage yesterday, the data is currently what we're focusing on with this release and will soon start shaping it to make it visualy look like the pre-existing excel-based Executive Report. #4 Problem: Error Checking - took 1:29, produced a line by line error sheet that is printable, *accepted BUT routing errors for lines 19-223 in the COB sheet produced a routing error that just states ""ERROR:"" no reason. We need to know why an error is shown(was run after all routes were deleted) *needs fix Solution: Error Checking will not spit out any errors if there aren't any. Path Confirmation: #1 Problem: One little housekeeping thing, can we move the delete button away from the confirm button? Perhaps on the other side of the exit button? This will save us mucho headaches later. OR make the dialog box look more like a warning that a record has been selected for deletion? Solution: Dialog box included for deletion alert confirmation purposes and button repositioned. thanks Asem x31700 PreSchedule Workspace: Running Build Route Report: Criteria Selection-unable to select criteria for build route, got ""List index out of bounds (4)"" error *needs fix Error Checking - took 1:29, produced a line by line error sheet that is printable, *accepted BUT routing errors for lines 19-223 in the COB sheet produced a routing error that just states ""ERROR:"" no reason.

Routing Mid C-13:27 Rockies-2:23 Palo 7:56 COB 5:12 the time is fine. **needs fix**The routes are still not showing designated Physical or Non-Physical Properly. All are coming through as Non-Physical. This is must be fixed prior to release for production as our WSCC fee pulls directly from this data in deal Scheduling. Path Confirmation: Speed is very much an issue here, I had Mark Guzman sit with me while I cut a path and when I confirmed a group of paths. The confirmation of 5 paths as a group took 70 seconds from the time I entered the name and hit the ""ok"" button until the confriming was completed. This is too long, we need this to be 20-30 seconds max. Currently, this process takes about 10 seconds in lotus. Confriming 2 paths with the 20th fully populated took 1:39. Cutting a path went fast enough until I closed the screen to go back to the confirmation report. This also took over a minute. This is another 10 second process in lotus. One little housekeeping thing, can we move the delete button away from the confirm button? Perhaps on the other side of the exit button? This will save us mucho headaches later. OR make the dialog box look more like a warning that a record has been selected for deletion? All of the sorting looks great, the paths are represented properly, we are very very close! Real Time Discussion: Where are we on this? I heard initial rumblings, but nothing lately. Here are the sheets that I have used to create data for 6/20 << File: COB_JUNE20_USEME.psc >> << File: Mid_C_June20.psc >> << File: Palo_June20.psc >> << File: Rockies_June_20.psc >> I can do more testing or Net meeting stuff tomorrow until about 10:30, but after that I have to be a scheduler for a couple of hours.

The order is placed easily and elementary. I would only recommend providing a more detailed guide for the user in Bulgarian.
What made me choose this product and this store is the promotional offer of a player with a bonus hard drive that was not available from other suppliers and stores.

The product I was looking for was only available from the store at an acceptable value for money. Apart from a request by telephone, sufficiently comprehensive information was provided.

In addition, when ordering over $ 100 - you get a gift laura Amati Elegance. The order arrived on December 20, 2017. You have no right to review, but due to the unkind placement in the box by the representatives of the top shop, the box itself was distorted, which is why the right service I find with the sole on top was crushed to the right side to the ankle. The deformation gives a prerequisite for serious discomfort. Given the hardness and specificity of the material, no relaxation is presumed. From there follows a call that you do not allow you to make for days because they close you with the replica ""We will contact you within three hours"" after writing emails and calling all possible phones I received a call to explain to me that they could not help me, after all this wait, and I had to contact ""Care Care"" .... From here they had no incoming and we are waiting again. In the explanation of the consultant, I learned that all this with the possible replacement of the service will happen after the New Year ... For the cover of everything the bracelet I had to receive as a gift was not in the shipment at all. Complete mockery.

"Hi guys. 

I wanted to let you know that I am extremely concerned about the Associate/Analyst program, so much so that I feel all the work I have done, and all the time I have spent on the program has had little impact outside Wharton/Penn recruiting. In fact we won't get more than 1 associate from Wharton this year for a variety of internal and external reasons. This program has brought incredible talent into the organization, but we have lost a lot of momentum over the last two years. 

In as much as I would like to continue to support the program, I can't in its current form, and don't have time to fix what I thought we had been addressing. The entire program is disfunctional, and the commercial teams are not lending support to the program. I'd be very happy to spend a few minutes of your time (rather than blather on in an email) to give you both my overview of the program, and suggest changes and improvements. 

You know you have my support, but the current state of affairs down there has gotten me to my rope's end with the program.",External Relationship

Dear Duc,

As per my explanation during my last visit at AECC, this email having some introduction of a pneumatic plug @ STOPPER used to plug/seal any type of pipeline for maintenance or service work. 

PRONAL having a know-how on this stopper since more than 30 years of experience and would make us a pioneer of this solution. We are not only supplying the STOPPER unit, but able to customize it to suit your need for your application with a competitive price.
The advantage of the STOPPER compared to the mechanical plug (conventional method) are:

• STOPPER having higher sealing stroke so that it can cover several pipe diameters
• STOPPER can follow to contour of the pipe (overcome sealing on pipe’s ovality problem)
• STOPPER pressure can always be monitored (consistency of sealing at all time)
• STOPPER easy to use as plug and play and no effort needed during operation
• STOPPER is light to carry – easy handling during operation

There are a lot several type of STOPPERS which can be presented to you upon your availability at your/client office.

It would be useful to the technical, engineering, and maintenance team for this kind of presentation.

Thank you so much for your time reading this email and please let me know on your availability for me make a presentation to you

Thanks for the good news.

But I am sorry that it is very difficult to consider that discount ratio in this offer.
It will be really great if we can put more than 15% margin and can offer the discount as you want.
But actually the manufacturers never expect that high profit generally and really difficult to absorb that rate from our side only.

For the first cooperation, I would like to make the total amount $20,000 to support you.

"Mark, I heard earlier today that the resolution of this matter has been to move confirmation/documentation to Calgary, but leave contract preparation and negotiation in Houston. 

I must admit disappoint with this bifurcated result, including for the following reasons: 

1. It has left, rightly or (I trust) wrongly, the impression that there is concern as to the ability of the Canadian lawyers to documment and negotiate the ISDAs, etc. If this is the case, I do not share the concern. The legal group in Canada is strong, deep, conscientious, and regularly excels at greater and more complex challenges which expose Enron Canada to greater 
risks in physical trading, origination, finance and structured transactions. 

2. For these reasons, the Canadian lawyers have the trust and confidence of the Canadian traders and originators, and their advice is sought and followed on all matters, including, frankly, financial trading. 

3. This result ignores the practical realities of time, space, efficiency, legal jurisdictions, marketplace knowledge and internal and external relationships. 

4. I feel that the we ought to have the opportunity to be exposed to, and be challenged by, all aspects of our business. 

In any event, please let me know who will be responsible for legal oversight of confirmation/documentation of financial transactions. For physical trading, we regularly advise on confirmation/documentation issues and, most notably, all structured trades and trades with a term of greater than one year are prepared and reviewed by Enron Canada legal. 

Regards, Peter.",External Relationship
